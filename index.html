Cato, a new recruit and the newly appointed second-in-command to Macro, will have more to prove than most. In a bloody skirmish with local tribes, Cato gets his first chance to prove that he's more than a callow, privileged youth. As their next campaign takes them to a land of unparalleled barbarity - Britain - a special mission unfolds, thrusting Cato and Macro headlong into a conspiracy that threatens to topple the Emperor himself.<br></p><p>Simon Scarrow is a high school history teacher living in Norfolk, England. This is his first book.<br>Chapter One An icy blast of wind swept into the latrine with the sentry. <br>&#x2018;Wagon&#x2019;s approaching, sir!&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Shut the bloody door! Anything else?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Small column of men.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Soldiers?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Hardly.&#x2019; The sentry grimaced. &#x2018;Unless there&#x2019;s been some change in marching drill.&#x2019; <br>The duty centurion glanced up sharply. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t recall asking for an opinion on policy, soldier.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;No, sir!&#x2019; The sentry snapped to attention under the glare of his superior. Only a few months earlier Lucius Cornelius Macro had been an optio and was still finding promotion to the centurionate hard to handle. His former comrades in the ranks were still inclined to treat him as an equal. It was hard to register a respectful attitude to one who so recently had been seen emptying his guts of a skinful of cheap wine. But, for some months before the promotion, Macro had been aware that senior officers were considering him for the first available vacancy in the centurionate and had done his best to keep indiscretions to a minimum. For, when all his qualities were placed in the balance, Macro was a good soldier &#x2013; when good soldiering was required &#x2013; conscientious in his duties, reliably obedient to orders and he could be counted on to hold firm in a fight and inspire others to do the same. <br>Macro suddenly realised that he had been gazing at the sentry for a while and that the legionary was shifting uncomfortably under his scrutiny, as one tends to in front of a silently staring superior. And officers could be such unpredictable bastards, the sentry thought nervously, first whiff of power and they either don&#x2019;t know what to do with it, or they insist on giving bloody-minded and stupid orders. <br>&#x2018;What are your orders, sir?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Orders?&#x2019; Macro frowned for a moment. &#x2018;All right then. I&#x2019;ll come. You get back to the gate.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Yes, sir.&#x2019; The sentry turned and hurriedly made his way out of the junior officers&#x2019; latrine block, pulling the door to as the half-dozen centurions glared after him. It was an unwritten rule that no-one, but no-one, permitted their men to interrupt proceedings in the latrine. Macro applied the sponge stick, pulled up his breeches and apologised to the other centurions before hurrying outside. <br>It was a filthy night and a cold northerly wind was blowing the rain down from the German forests. It swept across the Rhine, over the fortress walls and was funnelled into icy blasts between the barrack blocks. Macro suspected that he was keenly disapproved of by his new-found peers and was determined to prove them wrong. Not that this resolution was working out terribly successfully. The administrative duties relating to the command of eighty men were proving to be a nightmare &#x2013; ration-collection details, latrine rotas, sentry rotas, weapons inspections, barrack inspections, punishment ledgers, equipment procurement chits, arranging fodder for the section mules, taking charge of pay, savings and the funeral club. <br>The only help available for carrying out these duties came in the form of the century&#x2019;s clerk, a wizened old cove named Piso, who Macro suspected of being dishonest or simply incompetent. Macro had no way of finding out for himself, because he was all but illiterate. Brought up with only the most rudimentary knowledge of letters and numbers he could recognise most individually, but more than that was impossible. And now he was a centurion, a rank for whom literacy was a prerequisite. Doubtless the legate had naturally assumed Macro could read and write when he approved the appointment. If it came to light that he was no more literate than a Campanian farm boy, Macro knew he would be demoted at once. So far he had managed to get round the problem by delegating the paperwork to Piso and claiming that his other duties were keeping him too busy, but he was sure that the clerk had begun to suspect the truth. He shook his head as he trudged over to the fortress gate, pulling his red cloak tightly about him. <br>It was a dark night, made darker by the low clouds that completely obscured the sky; a sure sign that snow was on the way. From the gloom about him, Macro could hear a variety of sounds typical of the fortress existence that had been part of his life for over twelve years now. Mules brayed from stables at the far end of each barrack block and the voices of soldiers, talking and shouting, drifted out through the wavering light of candlelit windows. A bellow of laughter peeled out of a barrack block he was passing, followed by a lighter, female laugh. Macro halted mid-stride and listened. Someone had managed to sneak a woman into the base. The woman laughed again and then began speaking in thickly accented Latin and was quickly hushed by her companion. This was a flagrant breach of regulations and Macro abruptly turned towards the block and laid his hand on the latch. Then paused, thinking. By rights he should burst in, loudly bellowing in parade-ground fashion, send the soldier to the guard-house, and have the woman thrown out of the base. But that meant completing an entry in the punishment book &#x2013; more bloody writing. <br>Gritting his teeth, Macro released his grip and quietly stepped back into the street, just as the woman let out a shriek of laughter to prick his conscience. A quick glance about to make sure that no-one else was there to witness his failure to act and Macro hurried on towards the south gate. Bloody soldier deserved a good kicking, and if he had been in Macro&#x2019;s century that&#x2019;s how he&#x2019;d have been dealt with; no paperwork needed, just a swift kick in the balls to ensure the punishment fitted the crime. Still, from her voice she could only have been one of those nasty German tarts from the native settlement that sprawled just outside the base. Macro consoled himself with the thought of the legionary concerned coming down with a bad dose of the clap. <br>Although the streets were dark, Macro moved instinctively in the right direction since no legionary base deviated from the standard design used in all camps and fortresses. In a matter of minutes, he had emerged on to the wider thoroughfare of the Via Praetoria and marched towards the gate where the street passed through the walls to the south of the base. The sentry who had interrupted Macro at the latrine was waiting at the foot of the stairs. He led the way into the gatehouse and up the narrow wooden staircase to the battlement level, where a lit brazier cast a warm red glow around the sentry room. Four legionaries were squatting close to the fire playing dice. As soon as they saw the centurion&#x2019;s head appear above the stairs they stood to attention. <br>&#x2018;Easy lads,&#x2019; Macro said. &#x2018;Carry on.&#x2019; <br>The wooden door to the battlements sprang inwards with the wind as Macro lifted the latch and the brazier blazed momentarily as he stepped outside and slammed the door to. Up on the sentry walk the wind was biting and whipped Macro&#x2019;s cloak behind him, tugging at the clasp on his left shoulder. He shuddered and snatched it back, holding it tightly about his body. <br>&#x2018;Where?&#x2019; <br>The sentry peered out through the crenellations into the darkness and pointed his javelin at a tiny flickering light swinging from the back of a wagon approaching from the south. Straining his eyes as he stared into the wind, Macro could make out the outline of the wagon and, behind it, a body of men plodding along the track. At the rear of the column came the more orderly progress of the escort whose job was to stop the stragglers slowing the pace. Maybe two hundred men in all. <br>&#x2018;Shall I call out the guard, sir?&#x2019; <br>Macro turned towards the sentry. &#x2018;What did you say?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Shall I call out the guard, sir?&#x2019; <br>Macro eyed the man wearily. Syrus was one of the youngest men in the century and, although Macro had learned the names of most of his command, he knew little of their characters or histories as yet. &#x2018;Been in the army long?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;No, sir. Only a year in December.&#x2019; <br>Not long out of training then, Macro thought. A stickler for regulations, which he no doubt applied in every circumstance. He&#x2019;d learn in time; how to compromise between following strict procedure and doing what was needed to get by. <br>&#x2018;So then, why do we need to call out the guard?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Regulations, sir. If an unidentified body of men is approaching the camp in force the guard century should be called out to man the gate and adjacent walls.&#x2019; <br>Macro raised his eyebrows in surprise. The quotation was word perfect. Syrus clearly took his training seriously. &#x2018;And what then?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Sir?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;What happens next?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;The duty centurion, after assessing the situation determines whether or not to call a general alarm,&#x2019; Syrus continued tonelessly, then hurriedly added, &#x2018;Sir.&#x201d; <br>&#x2018;Good man.&#x2019; Macro smiled and the sentry smiled back in relief, before Macro turned back towards the approaching column. &#x2018;Now then, exactly how threatening do you think that lot is? Do they scare you, soldier? Do you think all two hundred of them are going to charge over here, climb the walls and slaughter every mother&#x2019;s son of the Second Legion . . . Well, do you?&#x2019; <br>The sentry looked at Macro, looked carefully at the flickering lights for a new moments and then turned back sheepishly. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think so, sir,&#x2019; said Macro gruffly as he punched the lad on the shoulder. <br>&#x2018;Sorry, sir.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Tell me, Syrus. Did you attend the sentry briefing before the watch?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Of course, sir.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Did you pay attention to every detail?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I think so, sir.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Then you would recall me saying that a replacement convoy was due to arrive at the base, wouldn&#x2019;t you? And then you wouldn&#x2019;t have had to haul me out of the latrine and spoil a particularly good shit.&#x2019; <br>The sentry was crestfallen and he could not bear the long-suffering expression on his centurion&#x2019;s face. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, sir. Won&#x2019;t happen again.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;You see that it doesn&#x2019;t. Or I&#x2019;ll have you on double duties for the rest of the year. Now get the rest of the lads ready at the gate. I&#x2019;ll deal with the recognition call.&#x2019; <br>Shamefaced, the sentry saluted and went back into the gatehouse. Soon Macro could hear the sounds of the guard rousing themselves and descending the wooden stairs to the main gate. Macro smiled. The lad was keen and felt guilty about his mistake. Guilty enough to make sure that it never happened again. That was good. That&#x2019;s how dependable soldiers were made &#x2013; there was no such thing as a born soldier, Macro reflected. <br>A sudden blast of wind buffeted Macro and he retreated into the shelter of the gatehouse. Inside he positioned himself close to the glowing brazier and let out a sigh of relief and the warmth soaked into his body. After a few moments, Macro opened the small viewing shutter and looked out into the night. The convoy was nearer now and he could make out the wagon in detail as well as the individual men in the following column. A miserable bunch of recruits, he thought, not an ounce of spirit in them. You could tell that by the apathetic way they trudged along, even though they were in sight of shelter. <br>Then it began to rain, quite suddenly, large drops flung diagonally by the wind that stung the skin. Even that failed to increase the pace of the convoy and, with a despairing shake of the head, Macro began the formalities. He opened the main shutter, leaned his head out of the window and filled his lungs. <br>&#x2018;Halt there!&#x2019; he shouted. &#x2018;Identify yourselves!&#x2019; <br>The wagon reined in a hundred feet from the wall and a figure beside the driver rose to reply. &#x2018;Reinforcement convoy from Aventicum and escort, Lucius Batiacus Bestia commanding.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Password?&#x2019; Macro demanded even though he knew Bestia well enough, the senior centurion of the Second Legion and therefore very much his superior. <br>&#x2018;Hedgehog. Permission to approach?&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;Approach, friend.&#x2019; <br>With a crack of the whip the wagoneer urged the bullocks up the rise that led to the gateway and Macro crossed over to the shutter that opened on to the inside of the fort. Down below, the sentries were clustered by the sidegate trying to keep out of the rain. <br>&#x2018;Open the gate,&#x2019; Macro called down. One of the soldiers quickly drew out the locking pin and the others slid the beam back into the recess. With a heavy wooden groan, the gates were pulled open just as the wagon reached the top of the rise, its momentum carrying it through the gate into the base. Looking down from the guardhouse, Macro watched the wagon draw up to one side. Bestia jumped down from the driver&#x2019;s bench and waved his vine cane at the sodden procession of new recruits passing by. <br>&#x2018;Come on, you bastards! Move! Quickly now! The sooner you&#x2019;re in, the sooner you can get warm and dry.&#x2019; <br>The recruits, who had followed the wagon for over two hundred miles, automatically began to mill round it once inside the gate. Most wore travelling cloaks and carried their few belongings in blankets tied across the shoulder. The poorest recruits had nothing, some didn&#x2019;t even have cloaks, and they shivered miserably as the wind drove the freezing rain at them. At the rear stood a small chain-gang of criminals who had opted for the army rather than remain in prison. <br>Bestia immediately waded into the growing crowd with his cane, beating a clear space for himself. <br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t just stand there like a herd of sheep! Make way for some real soldiers. Get over to the far side of the street and line up facing this way. NOW!&#x2019; <br>The last of the recruits stumbled in through the gate and followed the rest to take up an uneven line opposite the wagon. Finally the escort marched in, twenty men in step, who halted simultaneously at one word of command from Bestia. He paused for effect to let the implicit comparison sink in as Macro ordered the sentries to shut the gate and return to their duties. Bestia turned back to the recruits, legs astride and hands on hips. <br>&#x2018;Those men,&#x2019; Bestia nodded over his shoulder, &#x2018;belong to the Second Legion &#x2013; the Augusta &#x2013; the toughest in the entire Roman army, and you&#x2019;d better not forget it. There is no barbarian tribe, however remote, who hasn&#x2019;t heard of us and who doesn&#x2019;t live in mortal fear of us. The Second has killed more of these scum, and conquered more of their land, than any other unit. We have been able to do this because we train men to be the meanest, dirtiest, hardest fighters in the civilised world . . . You, on the other hand, are soft, worthless piles of shit. You are not even men. You are the lowest fucking form of life that ever claimed to be Roman. I despise each and every last fucking one of you, and I will weed out every worthless piece of scum so that only the best join my beloved Second Legion and serve under our eagle. I&#x2019;ve watched you all the way from Aventicum &#x2013; and, ladies, I&#x2019;m not impressed. You signed up and now you are all mine. I will train you, I will hurt you, I will make men of you. Then &#x2013; if and when I decide you are ready &#x2013; then I will let you become a legionary. If any one of you doesn&#x2019;t give me every last shred of energy and commitment then I will break him &#x2013; with this.&#x2019; He held the gnarled vine cane aloft for all to see, &#x2018;Do you shits understand?&#x2019; <br>There was a murmured assent from the recruits, some of whom were so tired they just nodded. <br>&#x2018;What was that supposed to be?&#x2019; Bestia shouted angrily. &#x2018;I can hardly fucking hear you!&#x2019; <br>He moved into the crowd and grabbed a recruit roughly by the collar of his travelling cloak. Macro noticed for the first time that this recruit was dressed differently from the others. The cut of his cloak was unmistakably expensive &#x2013; no matter how much mud was caked on to it. The recruit was taller than the rest, but thin and delicate-looking &#x2013; just the kind of victim to make an example of. <br>&#x2018;What the hell is this? What the fuck is a recruit doing with a better cloak than I ca...</p><h2>Certain Women</h2><p>As David Wheaton&#39;s enormous family gathers around his deathbed, Emma Wheaton, his actress daughter, compares her father&#39;s life with a play about the Old Testament King David written by her estranged husband</p><p>Madeline L&#39;Engle, the popular author of many books for children and adults, has interspersed her writing and teaching career with raising three children, maintaining an apartment in New York and a farmhouse of charming confusion which is called &#34;Crosswicks.&#34;In her latest foray into adult fiction (after A Severed Wasp, 1983, etc.), veteran author L'Engle recounts--with characteristic lucidity and wisdom--the tale of a dying actor paying tribute to the eight wives and eleven children he has loved. They not only share a name, they share a personal history: King David of the Bible and David Wheaton, well-known actor of stage and screen--each enjoyed many wives, saw their sons killed and their women martyred, but nevertheless managed to live long, deep, and fruitful lives. It makes sense, then, that when Wheaton's daughter, Emma, marries a rising young playwright committed to re- creating King David's life for the stage, Wheaton becomes obsessed with playing the leading role. Life hasn't worked out so neatly for the Wheatons, though: Niklaas Green, the playwright, has proved unable to complete the play; his marriage to Emma, herself now a successful stage actress, is disintegrating; and David has succumbed to cancer in his old age and wants only to bid those closest to him farewell. As the great actor rests aboard his comfortable boat, the Portia, tended by his most recent wife, Emma cooks meals, entertains her father, and reads through yellowed drafts of Nik's ``David'' play. Scenes of King David's life give rise to recollections of the Wheaton clan's own triumphs and tragedies: the loss of children in infancy, two sons' deaths during WW II, an assault on Emma by her older half-brother. As surviving ex-wives and grown children arrive for a final goodbye, they join David and Emma in meditating on the meaning of all their lives--and grope, even as the curtain lowers, toward what counts most. King David's life may prove less fascinating to the reader than it is to these characters. Nevertheless, the gentle, rhythmic quality of L'Engle's prose is perfectly attuned to this fictional aquatic cruise. A memorable work. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of their beginning, with Master and Commander, these evocative stories are being re-issued in paperback with smart new livery. This is the thirteenth book in the series.For all Jack Aubrey&#39;s life he has triumphed, often sensationally, over the dangers of the sea and the violence of the enemy. But his rashness, his guilelessness, his indiscretion have time and time again enabled his rivals to prevent him reaping his just rewards. The nadir was reached in The Reverse of the Medal when, the victim of a skilful frame-up, he was convicted of fraud and struck off the Navy list just as he was coming within sight of flag rank. The subsequent exposure of the conspiracy, coupled with his brilliant success in command of a privateer, had brought him to a position where Their Lordships were more or less bound to reinstate him.This, as the present book opens, they have done, and he and his old friend Dr Maturin are sailing on a secret mission with a hand-picked crew, most of them shipmates from the adventures and lucrative voyages of earlier years.</p><p>Will Napoleon Bonaparte form an alliance with the Malay princes of the South China Sea?

For readers of <i>The Alchemist</i> and other inspirational fables--this story of a young seeker named Clarion warmly communicates the unifying themes of the world's great religious traditions.Part teachings from the world's religions. Part New Age mysticism. Part The Little Prince. Wholly uninspiring. Clarion, the hero of this first novel, is a special person. Readers first encounter him as an old man, planting and tenderly nursing a garden on a desert mountain. When unprecedented rains fall and the desert blooms under his ministrations, people are drawn from all over to help, to marvel, and to learn. From earliest age, Clarion had been marked for greatness. After his father mysteriously abandons the boy and his mother, the lad gets wanderlust. When his mother tells him that he doesn't have to go to school anymore because the only power others have over us is power we give them, Clarion sets out in search of his father. He first encounters Samara, a woman who rescues him in a repetition of the story of the Good Samaritan. She teaches him that everything is possible if one loves and learns to communicate. She then passes him on to Jing, a Taoist from whom he learns to go with the flow of nature. In turn, Jing commends him to Baba, a Hindu master who gives him the lessons of self-abnegation and contemplation of the infinite. When Clarion is finally ready, Baba points him toward his father. Clarion discovers his deadbeat dad living as a kind of Buddhist monk. From this less than praiseworthy parent, Clarion learns to live in the ``now.'' The family is reunited without any hard feelings. The ultimate answer, he is told, is found in relationships with others. At once pretentious and simpleminded, the book was inspired by A Course in Miracles.

Dr. Steve Harper has provided a fresh, new introduction to John Wesley&#39;s teaching. Churches in the Wesleyan tradition (as well as others) have developed a new interest in getting back to these spiritual roots of their faith and practice, and this book provides a basis for understanding Wesley. More than a mere literal reproduction of eighteenth-century Wesleyan theology, this book offers a dynamic and practical introduction to Methodism. It reminds us of the Wesley we have forgotten and shows how Wesley promoted scriptural Christianity. It should be obvious from the following chapter titles that the themes of Wesleyan theology are presented in clear, contemporary language just as Wesley would have done if he were writing today--plain words for plain people - Meet John Wesley - The Root of the Problem (Original Sin) - Power to Begin (Prevenient Grace) - The Turning Point (Converting Grace) - Transformation (Effects of Salvation) - Don&#39;t Stop Now (Growth in Grace) - The Heart of It All (Christian Perfection) - The End of the Journey (Glorification) - All Together Now (The Church) - Renewal, The Wesley Way - A Basic Bibliography for Wesley StudiesSteve Harper is a retired professor of Spiritual Formation and Wesley Studies, and a retired Elder in the Florida Annual Conference of The United Methodist Church.</p><h2>Tartuffe and Other Plays</h2><p>Seven plays by the genius of French theater.<br><br> Including <i>The Ridiculous Precieuses</i>, <i>The School for Husbands</i>, <i>The School for Wives</i>, <i>Don Juan</i>, <i>The Versailles Impromptu</i>, and <i>The Critique of the School for Wives</i>, this collection showcases the talent of perhaps the greatest and best-loved French playwright.<br><br></p><p><p>Moliere was the stage name of Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622-1673).

To the reader as well as the spectator, today as well as three centuries ago, the appeal of his plays is immediate and durable; they are both instantly accessible and inexhaustible. His rich resources make it hard to decide, much less to agree, on the secret of his greatness. After generations had seen him mainly as a moralist, many critics today have shifted the stress to the director and actor whose life was the comic stage; but all ages have rejoiced in three somewhat overlapping qualities of his: comic inventiveness, richness of fabric, and insight.</p><p>His inventiveness is extraordinary. An actor-manager-director-playwright all in one, he knew and loved the stage as few have done, and wrote with it and his playgoing public always in mind. In a medium in which sustained power is one of the rarest virtues, he drew on the widest imaginable range, from the broadest slapstick to the subtlest irony, to carry out the arduous and underrated task of keeping an audience amused for five whole acts. Working usually under great pressure of time, he took his materials where he found them, yet always made them his own.</p><p>The fabric of his plays is rich in many ways: in the intense life he infuses into his characters; in his constant preoccupation with the comic mask, which makes most of his protagonists themselves&#x2014;consciously or unconsciously&#x2014;play a part, and leads to rich comedy when their nature forces them to drop the mask; and in the weight of seriousness and even poignancy that he dares to include in his comic vision. Again and again he leads us from the enjoyable but shallow reaction of laughing at a fool to recognizing in that fool others whom we know, and ultimately ourselves; which is surely the truest and deepest comic catharsis.</p><p>Moli�re&#x2019;s insight makes his characters understandable and gives a memorable inevitability to his comic effects. He is seldom completely realistic, of course; his characters, for example, tend to give themselves away more generously and laughably than is customary in life; but it is their true selves they give away. It is an obvious trick, and not very realistic, to have Orgon in <i>Tartuffe </i>(Act I, scene 4) reply four times to the account of his wife&#x2019;s illness with the question &#x201c;And Tartuffe?&#x201d; and reply, again four times, to each report of Tartuffe&#x2019;s gross health and appetite, &#x201c;Poor fellow!&#x201d; But it shows us, rapidly and comically, that Orgon&#x2019;s obsession has closed his mind and his ears to anything but what he wants to see and hear. In the following scene, it may be unrealistic to have him in one speech (ll. 276&#x2013;79) boast of learning from Tartuffe such detachment from worldly things that he could see his whole family die without concern, and in the very next speech (ll. 306&#x2013;10) praise Tartuffe for the scrupulousness that led him to reproach himself for killing a flea in too much anger. But&#x2014;again apart from the sheer comedy&#x2014;it is a telling commentary on the distortion of values that can come from extreme points of view. One of Moli�re&#x2019;s favorite authors, Montaigne, had written about victims of moral <i>hubris:</i> &#x201c;They want to get out of themselves and escape from the man. That is madness: instead of changing into angels, they change into beasts.&#x201d; Moli�re is presenting the same idea dramatically, as he does with even more power later (Act IV, scene 3, l. 1293), when Orgon&#x2019;s daughter has implored him not to force her to marry the repulsive Tartuffe, and he summons his will to resist her with these words:</p><p>Be firm, my heart! No human weakness now!</p><p>These moments of truth, these flashes of unconscious self-revelation that plunge us into the very center of an obsession, abound in Moli�re, adding to our insight even as they reveal his. And even as he caricatures aspects of himself in the reforming Alceste or in the jealous older lover in Arnolphe, so he imparts to his moments of truth not only the individuality of the particular obsession but also the universality of our common share in it.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Moli�re is one of those widely known public figures whose private life remains veiled. In his own time gossip was rife, but much of it comes from his enemies and is suspect. Our chief other source is his plays; but while these hint at his major concerns and lines of meditation, we must beware of reading them like avowals or his roles like disguised autobiography.*</p><p>He was born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin in Paris early in 1622 and baptized on January 15, the first son of a well-to-do bourgeois dealer in tapestry and upholstery. In 1631 his father bought the position of <i>valet de chambre tapissier ordinaire du roi, </i>and six years later obtained the right to pass it on at his own death to his oldest son, who took the appropriate &#x201c;oath of office&#x201d; at the age of fifteen. Together with many sons of the best families, Jean-Baptiste received an excellent education from the Jesuit Fathers of the Coll�ge de Clermont. He probably continued beyond the basic course in rhetoric to two years of philosophy and then law school, presumably at Orl�ans.</p><p>Suddenly, as it appears to us, just as he was reaching twenty-one, he resigned his survival rights to his father&#x2019;s court position, and with them the whole future that lay ahead of him; drew his share in the estate of his dead mother and a part of his own prospective inheritance; and six months later joined in forming, with and around Madeleine B�jart, a dramatic company, the Illustre-Th��tre. In September 1643 they rented a court-tennis court to perform in; in October they played in Rouen; in January 1644 they opened in Paris; in June young Poquelin was named head of the troupe, and signed himself, for the first time we know of, &#x201c;de Moli�re.&#x201d;</p><p>Moli�re&#x2019;s was an extraordinary decision. Apart from the financial hazards, his new profession stood little above pimping or stealing in the public eye and automatically involved minor excommunication from the Church. To write for the theater, especially tragedy, carried no great onus; to be an actor, especially in comedy and farce, was a proof of immorality. Though Richelieu&#x2019;s passion for the stage had improved its prestige somewhat, this meant only that a few voices were raised to maintain its possible innocence against the condemnation of the vast majority.</p><p>Obviously young Moli�re was in love with the theater, and had to act. He may also have been already in love with Madeleine B�jart; their contemporaries were probably right in thinking them lovers, though all we actually know is that they were stanch colleagues and business partners. Their loyalty was tested from the first. Although the B�jarts raised all the money they could, after a year and a half in Paris the company failed and had to break up; Moli�re was twice imprisoned in the Ch�telet for debt; he and the B�jarts left Paris to try their luck in the provinces. For twelve years they were on the road, mainly in the south.</p><p>For the first five of these they joined the company, headed by Du Fresne, of the Duc d&#x2019;�pernon in Guyenne. When d&#x2019;�pernon dropped them, Moli�re became head of the troupe. From 1653 to 1657 they were in the service of a great prince of the blood, the Prince de Conti, until his conversion. Even with a noble patron, the life was nomadic and precarious, and engagements hard to get. However, the company gradually made a name for itself and prospered. Moli�re gained a rich firsthand knowledge of life on many levels. In the last few years of their wanderings he tried his hand as a playwright with such plays as <i>L&#x2019;�tourdi </i>and <i>Le D�pit amoureux.</i></p><p>At last in 1658 they obtained another chance to play in the capital. On October 24 they appeared before young Louis XIV, his brother, and the court, in the guard room of the old Louvre, in a performance of Corneille&#x2019;s tragedy <i>Nicom�de, </i>which Moli�re followed with his own comedy <i>The Doctor in Love. </i>Soon they became the Troupe de Monsieur (the King&#x2019;s brother) and were installed by royal order in the Th��tre du Petit-Bourbon. Though they still performed tragedies, they succeeded more and more in comedy, in which Moli�re was on his way to recognition as the greatest actor of his time.</p><p>Within a year he made his mark also as a playwright with <i>The Ridiculous Pr�cieuses </i>(November 18, 1659), which, though little more than a sketch, bore the stamp of his originality, keen observation, and rich comic inventiveness.* Nearly thirty-eight, Moli�re was to have thirteen more years to live, and was to live them as though he knew this was all. To his responsibilities as director and actor he added a hectic but glorious career as a very productive playwright, author of thirty-two comedies that we know, of which a good third are among the comic masterpieces of world literature. The stress of his many roles, of deadlines, and of controversy is well depicted in <i>The Versailles Impromptu. </i>Success led to success&#x2014;and often to more controversy&#x2014;but never to respite. He was to be carried off the stage to his deathbed. No doubt he wanted it that way, or almost that way; for probably no man has ever been more possessed by the theater.</p><p>On February 20, 1662, at the age of forty, he married the twenty-year-old Armande B�jart, a daughter (according to the mostly spiteful contemporaries) or sister (according to the official documents) of Madeleine. Though what we know of their domestic life is almost nothing, contemporary gossip, a friend&#x2019;s letter, and Moli�re&#x2019;s own preoccupation in several plays with a jealous older man in love with a flighty young charmer, combine to suggest an uneasy relationship. They had two sons who died in infancy and a daughter who survived. The King himself and his sister-in-law (Madame) were godfather and godmother to the first boy&#x2014;no doubt to defend Moli�re against a charge, or rumor, that he had married his own daughter.</p><p>When the Petit-Bourbon theater was torn down in October 1660 to make way for the new fa�ade of the Louvre, things looked bad; but the King granted the company the use of Richelieu&#x2019;s great theater, the Palais-Royal, which remained Moli�re&#x2019;s until his death. An early success there was his regular, elaborate verse comedy, <i>The School for Husbands. </i>Within a year of his marriage he wrote his first great play and one of his most popular, <i>The School for Wives. </i>It aroused much controversy; when Moli�re published it, he dedicated it to Madame; the King gave him the support he sought in the form of a pension of one thousand francs for this &#x201c;excellent comic poet.&#x201d; <i>The Critique of the School for Wives </i>and <i>The Versailles Impromptu </i>(June and October 1663) completed Moli�re&#x2019;s victory in the eyes of the public.</p><p>However, his attack on extreme piety and hypocrisy in <i>Tartuffe </i>showed him the strength of his enemies. The first three-act version, performed in May 1664, was promptly banned. For the next five years much of his time and energy went into the fight to get it played: petitions, private readings, revisions, private performances. In August 1667 a five-act version entitled <i>The Impostor </i>was allowed a second public performance&#x2014;then also banned. Only in February 1669 was the version that we know put on, with enormous success; and this time it was on the program to stay.</p><p>Meanwhile Moli�re had hit back at his enemies in 1665 in <i>Don Juan, </i>which he soon withdrew. In August of that year his company became The King&#x2019;s Troupe, and his pension was raised to six thousand francs. A year later he completed his greatest and most complex play, <i>The Misanthrope, </i>which met only a modest success, and the light but brilliant farce that often served as a companion piece, <i>The Doctor in Spite of Himself. </i>In 1668 he displayed the bitter comic profundities of <i>The Miser; </i>and in the last four years of his life&#x2014;still to mention only his finest plays&#x2014;<i>The Would-Be Gentleman, The Mischievous Machinations of Scapin, The Learned Women, </i>and <i>The Imaginary Invalid.</i></p><p>Moli�re&#x2019;s last seven years were dogged by pulmonary illness. A bad bout in early 1666 and another in 1667 led him to accept a milk diet and spend much of the next four years apart from his wife in his house in Auteuil. The year before his own death saw those of his old friend Madeleine B�jart and later of his second son. As his health grew worse, he composed&#x2014;characteristically&#x2014;his final gay comedy about a healthy hypochondriac. Before its fourth performance, on February 17, 1673, he felt very ill; his wife and one of his actors urged him not to play that evening; he replied that the whole company depended a lot on him and that it was a point of honor to go on. He got through his part, in spite of one violent fit of coughing. A few hours later he was dead. Since he had not been able, while dying, to get a priest to come and receive his formal renunciation of his profession, a regular religious burial was denied at first, and later grudgingly granted&#x2014;at night, with no notice, ceremony, or service&#x2014;only after his widow&#x2019;s plea to the King. He died and was buried as he had lived&#x2014;as an actor.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Translations of Moli�re abound. Two of the most available, both complete, are by H. Baker and J. Miller (1739) and Henri Van Laun (1875&#x2013;76). The former is satisfactory, but its eighteenth-century flavor is not always Moli�re&#x2019;s; the latter is dull. Better for the modern reader are the versions of selected plays by John Wood (1953 and 1959), George Graveley (1956), and especially three others.</p><p>Curtis Hidden Page has translated eight well-chosen plays (Putnam, 1908, 2 vols.) which include three verse comedies done into unrhymed verse. Though it sometimes lacks sparkle, his version is always intelligent and responsible.</p><p>Morris Bishop&#x2019;s recent translation of nine plays (one for Crofts Classics, 1950, eight for Modern Library, 1957) is much the best we have for all but two. His excellent selection includes six in prose <i>(Pr�cieuses, Critique, Impromptu, Physician in Spite of Himself, Would-Be Gentleman, Would-Be Invalid) </i>and three done into unrhymed verse <i>(School for Wives, Tartuffe, Misanthrope). </i>His knowledge of Moli�re and talent for comic verse make his translation lively and racy, and his occasional liberties are usually well taken.</p><p>Richard Wilbur has translated Moli�re&#x2019;s two greatest verse plays, <i>The Misanthrope </i>and <i>Tartuffe, </i>into rhymed verse (Harcourt, Brace, &amp; World, Inc., 1955 and 1963). They are the best Moli�re we have in English. My sense of their excellence is perhaps best stated personally. I have long wanted to try my hand at translating Moli�re. When the Wilbur <i>Misanthrope </i>appeared, I decided not to attempt it unless I thought I would do that play either better or at least quite differently. When I finally tried it, I was surprised to find how different I wanted to make it. Wilbur&#x2019;s end product is superb; but in his <i>Misanthrope </i>I sometimes miss the accents of Moli�re.* His <i>Tartuffe </i>seems to me clearly better, since it follows the original closely even in detail. Both are...</p></p><h2>David: A Man of Passion &amp; Destiny</h2><p><p><strong>In the first and best-selling Great Lives book, <em>Great Lives: David</em>, Dr. Swindoll explores the Old Testament shepherd, king, and psalmist, to answer the question, "What does it mean to be someone after God's own heart?"</strong></p> <p>In many ways he was a most extraordinary man-intelligent, handsome, abundantly gifted as a poet, musician, warrior, and administrator. Yet in other ways he was a most ordinary man-often gripped by destructive passion, rocked by family chaos and personal tragedy, and motivated by political expediency. How did David become the national hero of God's chosen people? Why is he the one character in the Bible described as a "man after God's own heart"? Chuck Swindoll explores the many facets of David-from his teenaged years and dysfunctional family life to his overwhelming passion for God.</p></p><p><p>Charles R. Swindoll has devoted his life to the clear, practical teaching and application of God's Word. He currently pastors Stonebriar Community Church in Frisco, Texas, and serves as the chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary. His renowned Insight for Living radio program airs around the world. Chuck and Cynthia, his partner in life and ministry, have four grown children and ten grandchildren.</p>The humble shepherd David later became the great King David, spoken of in the Bible. Michael Kramer contrasts young David&#39;s sins and poor choices with his later courage and devotion to God--which led to his being described as &#39;&#39;a man after God&#39;s own heart.&#39;&#39; After Kramer&#39;s versatile range and skill depicts David&#39;s mighty battle with Goliath, Swindoll advises listeners to use their personal memories of past victories for battles with their own giants. With succinct clarity Kramer delivers additional spiritual tips from the author: Don&#39;t fight using your own strength--rely on the Lord. Don&#39;t abuse God&#39;s grace. Listen when God says no. Don&#39;t be intimidated or overly sensitive.

The instant of utter stillness when between two beats of the heart, an alternative reality can slip through, like a blade between the ribs, and switch you into a new and terrifying world. FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT: four heart-stopping accounts of that moment when the familiar world fractures beyond sense, the fragments spinning away from the desperate, clutching reach of sanity . . .</p><p>STEPHEN KING is a master of the novella and short narrative form. As he describes it: &#39;A short story is like a kiss in the dark from a stranger.&#39; King&#39;s novellas and stories are among his most popular and some have been turned into celebrated films including STAND BY ME and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.Stephen King stretches this short story into a novella. A young boy gets a mysterious Polaroid camera that only takes pictures of a mean dog. The magic camera is creating a portal so that the mean dog can come to Earth and eat people. The boy stops him. The end. The book is saved by narrator Tim Sample&#39;s relentless efforts to wring suspense from the many scenes that are not suspenseful, just drawn out descriptions of mundane things. Sample speaks urgently at the right times, but sometimes even that--combined with suspenseful music--isn&#39;t enough. King&#39;s novella would benefit from a brutal editor hacking away the nonessentials. It&#39;s one of his lesser works.

Napoleon developed what was perhaps the world's first "superpower," setting a pattern that would come to fruition in the twentieth century. From descriptions of Bonaparte's rise; through the years of the Second Coalition and the Grande Arm�e; to the heights of victory and the depths of defeat at Waterloo, a fascinating portrait emerges of a man and his methods. 224 pages, 70 color illus., 80 b/w illus., 7 3/4 x 10 3/8. <br></p><p>Military historian Gunther Rothenberg provides a detailed account of the Napoleonic Wars in this installment of Cassell's multivolume series covering the history of warfare. The treatment is predominantly military rather than social. The matter-of-fact, dispassionate text is rich in tactical details and statistics, augmented by contemporary paintings, well-designed maps, and diagrams. The actions of the protagonists' commanders are also critically assessed, with much attention given to Napoleon himself, stressing the power of his charisma but showing that his insistence on sole control ultimately proved a weakness. Significantly, <i>The Napoleonic Wars</i> aims to show that, far from being the end of a military era, this was a period marking the origins of modern warfare. Developments in army organization, strategy, and weaponry gained from the experience of over 20 years of war are progressively described. The main points of Rothenberg's argument, that Napoleonic strategies continued to be followed and that the sheer scale of war was revolutionary, are summed up in the brief epilogue. The bulk of the broadly chronological text is uncluttered by too much speculation; military-history buffs will appreciate <i>The Napoleonic Wars</i> for its clarity. <i>--Karen Tiley, Amazon.co.uk</i>Gunther Rothenberg was the world&#39;s leading authority on the Napoleonic Wars. He served with the British, Israeli and US Military and was Professor of History at Purdue University in the USA. He was the leading English-speaking historian of warfare in the German-speaking lands.

Then we tramped around the mountain, climbing bluffs and powering through scrub as we circled the massive cylinder. Once buried deep underground, the silo now stood at the outermost edge of the island, its eastern side fully exposed to the elements and dropping hundreds of feet to the ocean below.<br> &nbsp;<br> I shivered every time I saw it from this angle. The silo looked like a bird on an unsteady perch. A few hundred more feet of erosion and our supposedly indestructible lifeboat would&#x2019;ve crashed into the sea along with the rest of Idaho. It was a freaking miracle we&#x2019;d survived.<br> &nbsp;<br> Scanning the seaward-facing concrete, I tried to visualize where the back exit should be. So much had changed while we were inside the Program. I squinted into the sun, probing the pockmarked surface with my eyes, but came up empty. I was about to suggest we go back for binoculars when Akio&#x2019;s finger darted out. &#x201c;There.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d spotted an indentation maybe forty yards to our right and a dozen down. But I couldn&#x2019;t see if there was a door. &#x201c;Could be,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;But how do we check?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I glanced at the top of the silo, unreachable now with the mountainside gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Can&#x2019;t get up, can&#x2019;t go down. What a mess.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Akio had seen more than just the possible entry point. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a ridge below us that runs around the silo. I think we can get above the opening and rappel down to it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I blinked at him. &#x201c;Rappel. Down the cliff. Over the ocean.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Akio shrugged, the ghost of a smile appearing on his lips. &#x201c;You have a better idea?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I do not.&#x201d; My throat worked, but there was no other way. &#x201c;So let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Akio took the lead. We worked along a sharp defile to reach the ridge. It was a full three feet wide&#x2014;plenty big enough to feel comfortable if there hadn&#x2019;t been a hundred-yard death drop on the left side. As it was, I could barely breathe.<br> &nbsp;<br> I heard Kyle gasping behind me and took solace knowing I wasn&#x2019;t the only one about to crap his pants. For his part, Akio moved confidently, circling to a wider cleft above the indentation. Once inside there, I put my back against solid stone and tried to slow my stampeding heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re lucky.&#x201d; Akio patted a triangular spike of rock jutting up in the center of the cleft. &#x201c;We can tie off on this. I was worried two of us would have to anchor the line with body weight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shivered, thinking about that insane prospect, as Akio began securing ropes. He produced two sets of carabiners and snapped them in place, then handed me an ascender. &#x201c;For the climb back up. Wouldn&#x2019;t want to forget.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shoved mine deep into a pocket. There was nothing left to do but go.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;All right. Okay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One of us should stay here,&#x201d; Akio said. &#x201c;To watch the lines.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Kyle&#x2019;s hand flew up. I shot him a dirty look, but nodded. I was in charge of this mission. I had to go over the side.<br> &nbsp;<br> Akio offered to go first, but I shook my head roughly. If I didn&#x2019;t do it now, I never would. I clipped in and took a deep breath. Every kid in Fire Lake had gone rappelling at one time or another at Starlight&#x2019;s Edge summer camp. This wasn&#x2019;t novel. But a quick zip down a scouted pitch on lines laid by professionals was a little different from stepping off a vertical cliff above a death drop and hoping Kyle didn&#x2019;t accidentally let you die. We had no idea if this was even the right place. I&#x2019;d have to climb back up either way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just don&#x2019;t look down. That&#x2019;s always good advice, but especially now. Don&#x2019;t. Look. Down.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three deep inhales.<br> &nbsp;<br> I stepped backward off the cliff.<br> &nbsp;<br> The line played out easily. I worked cautiously down the face, being careful with my speed. After three bounds, I reached the indentation and was forced to look between my feet. I blanked out the crashing waves far below, focusing on the opening. It was a small cave of roughly the same dimensions as a school bus. I lowered myself to a lip where I could stand and scrambled to safer footing.<br> &nbsp;<br> A weathered blast door was tucked into the back of the recess before me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I let out a huge sob of relief.<br> &nbsp;<br> I called up to Akio, detached from the line, and approached the door. There was a wheel-locking mechanism. As Akio landed softly behind me, I grabbed it with both hands and yanked. The wheel didn&#x2019;t budge.<br> &nbsp;<br> My heart oozed through my shoes and off the cliff. This door hadn&#x2019;t been opened in millennia, and was exposed to the sea. Of course it didn&#x2019;t just spin. And we&#x2019;d brought nothing to cut the oxidation. This ball of rust might never open. Why hadn&#x2019;t I thought of this before?<br> &nbsp;<br> Akio unclipped and joined me in the back of the cave. We tried the wheel together, but it might as well have been part of the mountainside. I collapsed with an exasperated grunt. Akio sat down beside me and squeezed his forehead.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We probably should have thought this through a little more,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I bet the door is rusted shut.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You are clearly a master of door science.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It would&#x2019;ve been better if we&#x2019;d brought something to grease the wheel.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I chuckled sourly. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have this conversation up there next time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Deal. Of course, the door could also be locked.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I pressed my fists into my eyes sockets, then petulantly kicked the door. With a weary sigh, I fumbled for the radio in my pocket. Kyle could run back to the village and get what we needed. If the door was locked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, that would be that.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was fiddling with the frequency when the wheel next to my head abruptly started rotating. My eyes bugged. I grabbed Akio&#x2019;s knee. We scrambled to our feet as it spun several times, then stopped. Hinges groaned as the portal swung inward.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah Harden poked her head out. &#x201c;Took you long enough.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I blinked. Opened my mouth. Closed it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah&#x2019;s blue eyes rolled skyward. &#x201c;A thousand tons of rock just rained down on us. Did you think we&#x2019;d just sit around waiting for you bozos? Please tell me you fixed a rope.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She stepped from the tunnel, followed by a sniffling Jessica Cale. One by one, three more people emerged. Alice Cho. Susan Daughtridge. Colleen Plummer. All were dirt-smeared. Most were crying. I peered past them into the tunnel, expecting the rest of the silo squad, but no one else appeared.<br> &nbsp;<br> I aimed a confused glance at Sarah. She shook her head.<br> &nbsp;<br> My whole body went cold. &#x201c;Where are the others? Tiffani and Kristen? Devin? Are they trapped somewhere?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I glanced at Alice, who was staring at nothing. Colleen and Susan were hugging each other and wouldn&#x2019;t meet my eye. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re dead,&#x201d; Jessica wailed. &#x201c;The roof caved in and they all died!&#x201d; She slumped to her knees, sobbing, and covered her face.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah watched Jessica with distaste. No tears marred her eyes. Then she looked at me and I nearly shivered. &#x201c;Tiffani, Melissa, Emily, Kristen, and Devin were having dinner in the command center. The rest of us were in the living quarters. The blast door between the two levels was shut, which probably saved our lives. When we tried to open it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Sarah grimaced, the first human thing she&#x2019;d done since emerging. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s gone. They&#x2019;re gone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Akio turned to stare at the ocean. I shook my head, unwilling to accept what I was hearing. &#x201c;It might just be blocked. The rest of the shaft could&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I connected to a working camera in one of the storage alcoves,&#x201d; Sarah said curtly. &#x201c;The silo&#x2019;s entire ceiling collapsed down the shaft, crushing everything outside the lab complex. The command center is pulverized, Noah. So is everyone who was in there.&#x201d; She crossed her arms to reveal cracked, bleeding nails. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like we didn&#x2019;t try.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I gaped at Sarah, horrified. Five more classmates, dead. What am I going to tell Min?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I assume you have a way up from here?&#x201d; Sarah said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been waiting by this door for hours. It&#x2019;s the only way in or out now, and I was getting worried no one could reach it from above. The lab complex isn&#x2019;t damaged, and we sealed it, but I want to get topside and see what happened.&#x201d; She glanced at her companions. &#x201c;The others didn&#x2019;t want to stay underground alone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Up. Yes.&#x201d; I shook my head to clear it. &#x201c;We have ropes. Kyle is&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A concussion thumped from somewhere inside the tunnel, followed quickly by two more. The stone shook beneath our feet. My eyes met Sarah&#x2019;s as a crunching sound echoed along the passageway, growing louder by the second.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah flew to the open door, dropping a shoulder against the heavy steel. Akio and I leapt to flank her and together we forced the portal closed. Sarah turned the wheel, then jerked back as something heavy clanged against the door from the inside. The mountain groaned one last time, then went still.<br> &nbsp;<br> I slid down on my butt and wiped grime from my eyes. &#x201c;Will things stop breaking around here, please?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No way,&#x201d; Sarah whispered, dropping down beside me. The others were all panting like we&#x2019;d run a marathon.<br> &nbsp;<br> I rested my head back against the door. &#x201c;No way what? The tunnel imploded. Thank God we got here in time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah grabbed my shirt, yanking me close. &#x201c;Two major collapses in one day? Inside a military-grade disaster bunker that stood for over a million years? Get your head out of your ass, Livingston.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I gently extricated myself from her grip, then ran both palms over my face as the last twelve hours fell in on me like an avalanche. &#x201c;What are you saying, Sarah? I&#x2019;m too tired for games.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She shook her head with disgust. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m saying, Noah, that a storm didn&#x2019;t cause this damage. It&#x2019;s too much.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That got my attention. &#x201c;If not the storm, then what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She leaned back next to me, staring off into the distance. &#x201c;Not what, you idiot. Who.&#x201d;</p><h2>Reality Boxes: And Other Black Holes in Human Consciousness</h2><p><p>THE REALITY OF HUMAN REALITY BOXES<br> <br> In this lucid and absorbing work, Ingo Swann opens up the continuing story about the fuller extent of human consciousness and limitations imposed on it by human reality boxes, a.k.a. "socially constructed realities" and "personal realities."<br> <br> All cultures, societies, and individuals have fashioned reality boxes. Like language-making and other innate factors, this clearly indicates that somewhere in the motherboard of human consciousness there exists a versatile innate capability to do so.<br> <br> As advanced researchers of consciousnesses are beginning to suspect, this means that behind all of the thousands upon thousands of reality boxes are the impressive factors of innate human consciousness itself -- the sum of which must be far, far greater than smaller "reality" versions of it found in limited reality boxes -- from which many seek to escape.<br> <br> However, "getting out of the box" is something like escaping a prison, which one cannot really achieve unless one learns a great deal about the nature of the prison itself.<br> <br> Most reality-box constructions omit mention of how awesome and wonderful the individual and collective consciousness of our species actually is. Even so, this magical aspect of ourselves can be retrieved from the many wreckages brought about via conflicting reality-box endeavors. After all, the panorama of innate human consciousness does survive, and is always "there" behind whatever reality boxes are superimposed on it.</p></p><p></p><h2>Geographical Readers for Elementary Schools</h2><p><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

At the bottom, she finds herself immersed in a bizarre world full of strange creatures and bizarre goings-on. She tries pills and potions, and attends a very strange tea party and croquet match. An immensely witty mix of satire, puzzles,&nbsp;and drama, this is one of literature&#x2019;s most astute depictions of the experience of childhood.</p><p>That Alice. When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here. "'What is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures?'" What indeed? (All ages)Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>The Redneck Manifesto</h2><p>Explores the mind and soul of one of society&#39;s favorite punch lines, exposing the truth about this very human group of people who have been scorned and insulted enough and are tired of being dubbed &#34;white trash.&#34; 30,000 first printing.</p><p>In a book that is destined to be praised, reviled, cited, denounced, loved, and hated -- perhaps by the same reader -- culture maverick Jim Goad presents a thoroughly reasoned, darkly funny, and rampagingly angry defense of America's most maligned social group -- the cultural clan variously referred to as rednecks, hillbillies, white trash, crackers, and trailer trash (provided they're white trailer trash, of course). <p>As <i>The Redneck Manifesto</i> boldly points out and brilliantly demonstrates, America's dirty little secret isn't racism, but classism. While pouncing incessantly on racial themes, most major media are silent about America's widening class rifts, a problem which negatively affects more people of all colors than does racism. In a nation obsessed with race, this book switches the focus firmly back toward class, and it warns in a voice loud and clear that America will never learn the true meaning of tolerance until it learns to embrace the redneck. </p><p>Until this book, no one has so fully explained why white trash exists in America. Tracing the unique historical diaspora of America's white poor, <i>The Redneck Manifesto</i> offers evidence that mass forceful deportations of white slaves and convict laborers from the British Isles formed the bulk of America's white underclass. Tracing the history of these people, the book probes the hidden cultural meanings behind jokes about inbreeding and bestiality. It gets its hands dirty with blue-collar frustration, recreational desperation, and religious salvation. It discusses the value of Elvis, Bigfoot, and space aliens as objects of spiritual veneration. It offers solid logical defenses of tax protest, gun ownership, and antigovernment "hate speech." And it lists surprising reasons for why rednecks and blacks have more in common with each other than either group does with white liberals. </p><p>With an unmatched ability for rubbing salt in cultural wounds, Jim Goad deftly dismantles most popular American notions about race and culture and takes a sledgehammer to our delicate glass-blown popular conceptions of government, religion, media, and history. His own socioeconomic background leads him to prefer crackers over slackers, hillbillies over hipsters, and white trash over white cash. He is certain that the trailer park holds more honest people than the House of Representatives, and he knows from personal experience that truck drivers are more trustworthy than lawyers. </p><p>You've not read another book like <i>The Redneck Manifesto</i> because there are no other books like it. It's the sort of book that comes along once in a lifetime, which will be too often for some people. It's a rude awakening for a spazzed-out nation. A fire under the ass of a culturally confused country. A literary laxative for a constipated public. It's destined to prick the conscience of a nation which enjoys feeling guilty, but which doesn't like to do anything about it. You'll laugh, and then you'll hate yourself for laughing. Your mind will be pried open but it'll only hurt a little while.</p>Jim Goad Jim Goad, himself a proud member of The White Trash Nation, is the creator of and chief writer for <i>ANSWER Me!</i>, a controversial "zine" that he and his wife publish out of their home in Portland, Oregon. He does not presently live in a trailer park but is thinking about it. <i>The Redneck Manifesto</i> is his first book.</p><h2>Baby: Faces!

Unfortunately, their excitement derails when they discover things at their new home are not what they expected. Bossy wooden trains blare orders, and the old tracks snore on the floor. But with a little creativity, the three new tracks work together to prove that you really can teach old tracks &#x2015; and trains! &#x2015; new tricks.<br><br>With rhyming text and clever word play, <i>Old Tracks, New Tricks</i> is sure to entertain parents and children of all ages, from train-obsessed toddlers to school-age kids looking for new ways to play with their old favorite toys. Full directions for each fun "trick" from the story can be found at the back of the book to inspire hours of creative train play.</p></p><p><p><b>Jessica Petersen</b> is the author, illustrator, and photographer of the picture book <i>Old Tracks, New Tricks</i>. She is also the creator of the popular blog, Play Trains!</p>K-Gr 3&#x2014;Wooden toy train tracks want to be taken home from the store and played with, so they perform some tricks. Sure enough, they attract the attention of a young engineer, and home they go. Once there, the new tracks are added to the old tracks and the old trains. However, the old tracks are not keen on the new ones. The old trains pressure the tracks to work together so they can drive. Soon, the new tracks show the old tracks new tricks that have little to do with trains. They make shapes, build towers, and play dominoes. The trains see how much fun the tracks are having together, so they decide to join in the fun of playing creatively rather than puffing and chuffing along in a traditional manner. Several pages at the end of the book encourage readers to come up with their own inventive play with a five-step process. In addition, the last few pages feature a picture of each type of play the tracks engaged in, such as "track art" or "tricks with blocks," with a list of materials and instructions. The images are full-color photographs digitized with smiley-type faces. The old tracks are charmingly dinged or covered in childlike embellishments, including stickers and crayons. Conversation bubbles between the tracks and trains tell most of the story. At times, the photographs are so full of conversation bubbles, tracks, trains, and other toys that the pages become a visual jumble. A few outlined text boxes struggle to keep the narrative going in the confusion. The often rhyming text, while at times clever, is also occasionally forced. For these reasons, it may be difficult for younger readers and listeners to follow the story. VERDICT Children who think they have outgrown their preschool toys may be inspired to think outside the box and learn to play creatively.

Its founder, Sofia Cavalletti, wrote this book to provide background at an adult level for catechists who work with children. In this book, she focuses on the elementary--the most basic--aspects of Christian liturgy: its history, symbols, meaning, and centeredness in Christ.

In recent years, authority has been seen as an enemy of freedom, autonomy, and development. In this book, the renowned philosopher Yves R. Simon, himself a passionate proponent of liberty, analyzes the idea of authority and definds it as an essential concomitant of liberty. Simon sees authority as the catalyst necessary to bring together the seemingly disparate demands of liberty on one hand and order on the other. Simon&#x2019;s perceptive discussion of how authority differs from law enables him to highlight the effective and personal role that authority can play in the life of the individual and for the good of the community.</p><p>Yves R. Simon was a renowned philosopher and teacher at several American universities, including the University of Notre Dame and the University of Chicago. He published numerous books and articles, many of which remain as classic pieces of political and social philosophy. Professor Simon died in 1961.Clear, powerful and perceptive; it will be read with profit for generations to come.

It will guide him (and her, if she&#39;s interested) through the questions that need to be answered, and the decisions that need to be made to start the new distiller on the way to creating that first amber drop of ambrosia. You&#39;ll learn distillation lore, which dangers are real, and which are bogus. You&#39;ll learn how to build a small but useful coffeepot still in a day, without soldering, and the next day you&#39;ll learn how to make a respectable brandy from the cheapest grocery store wine in that still. You&#39;ll build on your experiences with the coffeepot still to construct a 5-gallon potstill, and then a 15-gallon potstill. Making Fine Spirits is also a book for the advanced potstiller as well. You&#39;ll design and ferment washes, and distill them while making the cuts to get only the finest spirit, and you&#39;ll pick the appropriate aging chemistry to enhance even further the quality and complexity of what you&#39;ve made. And after you&#39;ve done all that, you&#39;ll realize that your spirits have become as good as, or most commonly, better than, what you are used to drinking. At that point, you&#39;ll start buying the odd very-high-end spirit, just to see what they did and plot to copy it. At that point you can truly say you are making fine spirits.</p><p></p><h2>Thin Wood Walls</h2><p>Eleven-year-old Joe Hanada likes playing basketball with his best friend, Ray, writing plays and stories, and thinking about the upcoming Christmas holiday. But his world falls apart when Japanese planes bomb Pearl Harbor. His country goes to war. The FBI takes his father away. And neighbors and friends in his hometown near Seattle begin to suspect Joe, his family, and all Japanese Americans of spying for the enemy.<br> When the government orders people of Japanese heritage living on the West Coast to move to internment camps, Joe turns to the journal his father gave him to record his thoughts and feelings. Writing journal entries and haiku poetry offers some relief as Joe struggles to endure life in Tule Lake War Relocation Camp&#x2014;days filled with boredom, concern for his father, and worry for his brother, who joins the American army to prove the bravery and loyalty of Japanese American citizens. Thin Wood Walls is a powerful story of a boy who grows up quickly in a changed world.</p><p>David Patneaude was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, but has spent most of his life in and around Seattle, Washington, where parts of Thin Wood Walls take place. Stories a friend&#x2019;s family told him about their internment during World War II inspired him to research and write this story.Grade 5-8&#x2013;The bombing of Pearl Harbor puts an end to 11-year-old Joe Hanada's happy-go-lucky life in the White River Valley near Seattle. Basketball, marbles, and Christmas plans are suddenly overshadowed by fears about the war. When longtime acquaintances begin to suspect Japanese-Americans of being spies, even the loyalty of Joe's Caucasian best friend can't soften the hurt of being called names or of having his father, a leader in the Issei community, taken away by the FBI. Joe finds comfort in his journal, where he records his impressions in both prose and haiku. After he is sent to the Tule Lake Relocation Camp in California with his older brother Mike and their mother and grandmother, Joe finds relief from the tedium of confinement in his writing. When Mike turns 18, he volunteers for the Army, eager to prove his loyalty. Not all of the detainees share his desire to fight for the U.S. Some request repatriation to Japan, while others forbid their children to speak English. The inclusion of many differing viewpoints within the Japanese-American community makes this book unique.

His interest in American folk music, jazz, and original composition are blended into a unique vocal and instrumental sound. His compositions are fresh and his energetic, exuberant stage personality, along with his driving rhythm and lead work, set the tone for a warm and exciting performance. He began playing guitar at age twelve. After college, he relocated to the Bay Area where his interest in hybrid acoustic string music led him to David Grisman&#39;s prototype quintet in the mid-1970&#39;s. Bruce eventually teamed up with the mandolinist and edited the magazine Mandolin World News from 1978 until 1984. In 1978 Bruce formed the band Back Up and Push to explore the emerging possibilities of swing and jazz on acoustic stringed instruments. The band toured the west coast throughout the 1980s and accompanied Bruce on his release Tuxedo Blues, which features many of his original instrumental and vocal compositions. Dix Bruce has done studio work on guitar, mandolin, and banjo and has recorded two albums with mandolin legend Frank Wakefield, six big band CDs with the Royal society Jazz Orchestra, and his own collection of American folk songs entitled My Folk Heart on which he plays guitar, mandolin, and autoharp as well as sings. In 1991 he contributed two original compositions to the soundtrack of Harrod Blank&#39;s acclaimed documentary Wild Wheels. he has released two CDs of traditional American songs with and originals with guitarist Jim Nunally.

Accompanied by the largest armed expeditionary force ever sent to North America, Braddock&#x2019;s primary target was the Forks of the Ohio, where he planned to seize Fort Duquesne (at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), and then march north into Canada. After landing in Alexandria, Virginia, and organizing his troops and supply chain, Braddock and his expedition began its nearly 250-mile trek, heroically cutting through uncharted wilderness, fording rivers, and scaling the Appalachian mountains, all while hauling baggage and heavy artillery. Braddock was joined on this epic mission by a young Virginia colonel, George Washington, and others who would later play major roles in the American Revolution, including Horatio Gates, Thomas Gage, and Charles Lee; among those driving the expedition&#x2019;s wagons were Daniel Boone and Daniel Morgan. Having withstood the harsh frontier and finally marching upon Fort Duquesne on a hot July morning, Braddock&#x2019;s exhausted column was ambushed by a combined French and Indian force. Over two-thirds of Braddock&#x2019;s British and colonial troops were killed or wounded, including Braddock himself, struck by a bullet in the chest while attempting to rally his disoriented troops. George Washington miraculously escaped harm despite four bullet holes through his clothing. With this battle, North America became the greatest stake in the global war between France and Great Britain.</p><p></p><p> In <i>Braddock&#x2019;s March: How the Man Sent to Seize a Continent Changed American History</i>, Thomas E. Crocker tells the riveting story of one of the most important events in colonial America. Not only did Braddock&#x2019;s expedition have a profound impact on American political and military developments, this fateful march laid the foundation for the &#x201c;National Pike,&#x201d; the major road for westward expansion, launched the career of George Washington, and sowed the seeds of dissent between&nbsp; England and its colonies that would ultimately lead to the American Revolution.</p></p><p><p>THOMAS E.

CROCKER is a partner in a Washington, D.C. lawfirm. He lives with his family in Virginia.Attorney Crocker brings comprehensive research and fresh perspective to his first work He presents Sir William Braddock's disastrous 1755 campaign against the French as a defining event of American history, not a one-shot loss. It brought together a large number of men who later played prominent roles on both sides of the Revolutionary War&#x2014;not only George Washington but Thomas Gage and Charles Lee, Daniel Morgan and Daniel Boone, among others. The campaign provided lessons that shaped the American consciousness. It showed the vulnerability of the British redcoats and the potential of irregular warfare. It introduced the political issues of burden sharing and taxation. Above all, says Crocker, Braddock's march was a human story. In his fast-paced description of events, Crocker calls it a pilgrimage of destiny. At the narrative's center is the general. Hard-drinking, hard-driving, sustaining discipline with the lash and confronting increasing disaffection, Braddock was more complex&#x2014;and more competent&#x2014;than the stubborn dunce of myth. Crocker describes him as done in... by a confluence of adverse circumstances ranging from geography to lack of support from the colonies. The judgment is debatable, but Crocker's justification is worth reading. 66 illus. <i>(Oct. 1)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You will find yourself rolling off the sofa snorting with laughter as she recalls with her signature clarity and wisdom everything she hasn&#39;t (yet) forgotten, including what it feels like to produce a flop - and you will swallow down a lump in your throat at the poignancy of her insights into the pain of losing friends, and the guilt of separation and divorce. One thing is for sure, there is nobody else who can put her finger so very precisely, so beguilingly, with so much wisdom and with so much wit, on what we all struggle with as we journey into our later years.</p><p>Nora Ephron was an Academy Award-winning screenwriter and film director of When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, You&#39;ve Got Mail and Bewitched. She was also a bestselling novelist (Heartburn, made into a film starring Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep), journalist and essayist (Crazy Salad).<i>I Remember Nothing</i><br><br>I have been forgetting things for years&#x2014;at least since I was in my thirties. I know this because I wrote something about it at the time. I have proof. Of course, I can't remember exactly where I wrote about it, or when, but I could probably hunt it up if I had to.<br><br>In my early days of forgetting things, words would slip away, and names. I did what you normally do when this happens: I scrolled through a mental dictionary, trying to figure out what letter the word began with, and how many syllables were involved. Eventually the lost thing would float back into my head, recaptured. I never took such lapses as harbingers of doom, or old age, or actual senescence. I always knew that whatever I'd forgotten was eventually going to come back to me sooner or later. Once I went to a store to buy a book about Alzheimer's disease and forgot the name of it. I thought it was funny. And it was, at the time.<br><br>Here's a thing I've never been able to remember: the title of that movie with Jeremy Irons. The one about Claus von B�low. You know the one. All I ever succeeded in remembering was that it was three words long, and the middle word was "of." For many years, this did not bother me at all, because no one I knew could ever think of the title either. One night, eight of us were at the theater together, and not one of us could retrieve it. Finally, at intermission, someone went out to the street and Googled it; we were all informed of the title and we all vowed to remember it forever. For all I know, the other seven did. I, on the other hand, am back to remembering that it's three words long with an "of" in the middle.<br><br>By the way, when we finally learned the title that night, we all agreed it was a bad title. No wonder we didn't remember it.<br>I am going to Google for the name of that movie. Be right back. . . .<br>It's <i>Reversal of Fortune</i>.<br><br>How is one to remember that title? It has nothing to do with anything.<br><br>But here's the point: I have been forgetting things for years, but now I forget in a new way. I used to believe I could eventually retrieve whatever was lost and then commit it to memory. Now I know I can't possibly. Whatever's gone is hopelessly gone. And what's new doesn't stick.<br><br>The other night I met a man who informed me that he had a neurological disorder and couldn't remember the faces of people he'd met.

A couple of years ago, the actor Ryan O'Neal confessed that he'd recently failed to recognize his own daughter, Tatum, at a funeral and had accidentally made a pass at her.

Where do I know her from? Then she spoke and I realized it was my sister Amy.<br><br>You might think, Well, how was she to know her sister would be in Las Vegas? I'm sorry to report that not only did I know, but she was the person I was meeting in the mall.<br><br>All this makes me feel sad, and wistful, but mostly it makes me feel old. I have many symptoms of old age, aside from the physical. I occasionally repeat myself. I use the expression, "When I was young." Often I don't get the joke, although I pretend that I do. If I go see a play or a movie for a second time, it's as if I didn't see it at all the first time, even if the first time was just recently. I have no idea who anyone in <i>People</i> magazine is.<br><br>I used to think my problem was that my disk was full; now I'm forced to conclude that the opposite is true: it's becoming empty.<br><br>I have not yet reached the nadir of old age, the Land of Anecdote, but I'm approaching it.<br><br>I know, I know, I should have kept a journal.

It was June 1961, and I was on my way to a political internship at the Kennedy White House. All the Wellesley/Vassar interns drove to Hyde Park to meet the former first lady. I was dying to meet her. I'd grown up with a photograph in our den of her standing with my parents backstage at a play they'd written. My mother was wearing a corsage and Eleanor wore pearls. It was a photograph I always thought of as iconic, if I'm using the word correctly, which, if I am, it will be for the first time. We were among the thousands of Americans (mostly Jews) who had dens, and, in their dens, photos of Eleanor Roosevelt. I idolized the woman. I couldn't believe I was going to be in the same room with her. So what was she like that day in Hyde Park, you may wonder. I HAVE NO IDEA. I can't remember what she said or what she wore; I can barely summon up a mental picture of the room where we met her, although I have a very vague memory of drapes. But here's what I do remember: I got lost on the way. And ever since, every time I've been on the Taconic State Parkway, I'm reminded that I got lost there on the way to meet Eleanor Roosevelt. But I don't remember a thing about Eleanor Roosevelt herself.<br><br>In 1964 the Beatles came to New York for the first time. I was a newspaper reporter and I was sent to the airport to cover their arrival. It was a Friday. I spent the weekend following them around. Sunday night they appeared on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>. You could make an argument that the sixties began that night, on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>. It was a historic night. I was there. I stood in the back of the Ed Sullivan Theater and watched. I remember how amazingly obnoxious the fans were-the teenage girls who screamed and yelled and behaved like idiots. But how were the Beatles, you may ask. Well, you are asking the wrong person. I could barely hear them.<br><br>I marched on Washington to protest the war in Vietnam. This was in 1967, and it was the most significant event of the antiwar movement. Thousands and thousands of people were there. I went with a lawyer I was dating. We spent most of the day in a hotel room having sex. I am not proud of this, but I mention it because it explains why I honestly cannot remember anything about the protest, including whether I ever even got to the Pentagon. I don't think I did. I don't think I've ever been to the Pentagon. But I wouldn't bet a nickel on it one way or the other.<br><br>Norman Mailer wrote an entire book about this march, called <i>The Armies of the Night</i>. It was 562 pages long. It won the Pulitzer Prize. And I can barely write two paragraphs about it.

Yet behind this triumph lay struggle, heartbreak, bitterness, frustration, lost love, exile&#x2014;and above all the miracle of survival.<br><br>Born into near poverty in Russia in 1887, the son of a Jewish herring merchant, Chagall fled the repressive &#x201c;potato-colored&#x201d; tsarist empire in 1911 for Paris. There he worked alongside Modigliani and L�ger in the tumbledown tenement called La Ruche, where &#x201c;one either died or came out famous.&#x201d; But turmoil lay ahead&#x2014;war and revolution; a period as an improbable artistic commissar in the young Soviet Union; a difficult existence in Weimar Germany, occupied France, and eventually the United States. Throughout, as Jackie Wullschlager makes plain in this groundbreaking biography, he never ceased giving form on canvas to his dreams, longings, and memories. <br><br>His subject, more often than not, was the shtetl life of his childhood, the wooden huts and synagogues, the goatherds, rabbis, and violinists&#x2014;the whole lost world of Eastern European Jewry. Wullschlager brilliantly describes this world and evokes the characters who peopled it: Chagall&#x2019;s passionate, energetic mother, Feiga-Ita; his eccentric fellow painter and teacher Bakst; his clever, intense first wife, Bella; their glamorous daughter, Ida; his tough-minded final companion and wife, Vava; and the colorful, tragic array of artist, actor, and writer friends who perished under the Stalinist regime.<br><br>Wullschlager explores in detail Chagall&#x2019;s complex relationship with Russia and makes clear the Russian dimension he brought to Western modernism. She shows how, as Andr� Breton put it, &#x201c;under his sole impulse, metaphor made its triumphal entry into modern painting,&#x201d; and helped shape the new surrealist movement. As art critic of the<i> Financial Times,</i> she provides a breadth of knowledge on Chagall&#x2019;s work, and at the same time as an experienced biographer she brings Chagall the man fully to life&#x2014;ambitious, charming, suspicious, funny, contradictory, dependent, but above all obsessively determined to produce art of singular beauty and emotional depth.<br><br>Drawing upon hitherto unseen archival material, including numerous letters from the family collection in Paris, and illustrated with nearly two hundred paintings, drawings, and photographs, <i>Chagall</i> is a landmark biography to rank with Hilary Spurling&#x2019;s <i>Matisse</i> and John Richardson&#x2019;s <i>Picasso.<br></i></p><p>Jackie Wullschlager is chief art critic for the <i>Financial Times. </i>Her books include a prizewinning life of Hans<i> </i>Christian Andersen and an acclaimed group biography of<i> </i>children&#x2019;s book writers, <i>Inventing Wonderland.</i>&#x201c;My Sad and Joyful Town&#x201d;<i>Vitebsk, 1887&#x2013;1900 </i>Every painter is born somewhere,&#x201d; Chagall mused as an exile in the United States in the 1940s. &#x201c;And even though he may later respond to the influences of other atmospheres, a certain essence&#x2014;a certain &#x2018;aroma&#x2019; of his birthplace clings to his work. . .The vital mark these early influences leave is, as it were, on the handwriting of the artist. This is clear to us in the character of the trees and card players of a C�zanne, born in France,&#x2014;in the curled sinuosities of the horizons and figures of a Van Gogh, born in Holland,&#x2014;in the almost Arab ornamentation of a Picasso, born in Spain&#x2014;or in the quattrocento linear feeling of a Modigliani, born in Italy. That is the manner in which I hope I have preserved the influences of my childhood.&#x201d; Vitebsk, &#x201c;my sad and joyful town,&#x201d; was approaching the zenith of its development as a solid, provincial military outpost of the vast Russian empire when Chagall was born there on 7 July 1887. The baroque green and white Uspensky Cathedral, on the hill crowning the city skyline of thirty bright onion-domed churches and sixty synagogues, and the jumble of wooden houses and wandering Jews depicted in paintings such as <i>Over Vitebsk</i> announce a long, mixed cultural heritage. The artist Ilya Repin called Vitebsk &#x201c;the Russian Toledo&#x201d; because, like El Greco&#x2019;s city, its tumbling silhouette was characterized by a mix of Christian and Jewish spires, towers, and domes, dating back to the twelfth-century Church of the Annunciation. Set in a region of blue lakes, pine forests, broad plains, and gentle hills, the picturesque old White Russian city rises high on the banks of the wide Dvina River where two tributaries, the Vitba and the Luchesa, join it. Life here, during snow-filled six-month winters and short sultry summers, when bathing huts appeared briefly on the riverbanks, had always been tough: Vitebsk was a contested town throughout its history. A fortification on the profitable trading routes between Kiev, Novgorod, Byzantium, and the Baltic Sea since the tenth century, it belonged to Lithuania in the Middle Ages, then to Poland, though it was frequently torched by invading Russians. It was annexed by Russia in the eighteenth century and became the northeastern fringe of the Pale of Settlement, the area&#x2014;comprising present-day Belarus, Lithuania, parts of Poland, Latvia, and Ukraine&#x2014;to which Catherine the Great confined all the Jews of her empire. By 1890 there were five million of them there, concentrated in middle-sized towns like Vitebsk and neighbouring Dvinsk (now Daugavpils) and constituting 40 percent of world Jewry. From the 1860s the new Moscow&#x2013;Riga and Kiev&#x2013;St. Petersburg railways, crossing in Vitebsk, brought people streaming into the city from the countryside, and thus for the first time an urban proletariat appeared here. Between 1860 and 1890 Vitebsk&#x2019;s population doubled to 66,000 people: more than half of them were Jews, engaged mostly in the small trading enterprises&#x2014;dealing in paper, oil, iron, fur, flour, sugar, herring&#x2014;by which the town thrived. The rest were Russians, White Russians, and Poles, but so vital were the Jews in trade and business that one inhabitant recalled, If I were a stranger and not a Vitebskite, and after having read the signs on stores and the names of tenants and offices, recorded on the lists of tenants in every yard along all the streets, I would have said that Vitebsk was a purely Jewish city, built by Jews, with their initiative, energy, and money. The sense that Vitebsk is a Jewish city is felt especially on Sabbath and Jewish holidays, when all the stores, offices, factories are closed and silent. Even in government offices, such as the Government Bank, the Notary, the Courthouse, Post and Telegraph Offices, and so on. Yiddish, here as throughout the Pale, was mother tongue to almost all the Jewish population, half of whom could speak nothing else. It set the Jewish culture of cities like Vitebsk apart from the sea of backward, brutalised Slavic villages that encircled them, their peasants still serfs only a generation before Chagall&#x2019;s birth. Yiddish was Chagall&#x2019;s principal language until adolescence, the language of the family home, and its use enshrined a feeling of security and belonging, of participating in an autonomous system of values, religious traditions, and laws, that a Jew in the nineteenth century could find nowhere else. The Jews who arrived in Vitebsk from smaller settlements in the Pale, therefore, felt quickly at home. Among them in 1886 was a slim, slight girl of twenty, Feiga-Ita Tchernina, eldest daughter of the kosher butcher and slaughterer in the small country town of Lyozno, forty miles to the east. Her mother, Chana, had recently died, and Feiga-Ita was leaving behind a slumbering existence where her father &#x201c;lay half his life on top of the stove, a quarter in the synagogue, and the rest in the butcher shop,&#x201d; surrounded by the indolent among his offspring, the ones who had not made it to the city. His famous grandson later portrayed them, affectionately, as a caricature of Russian provincial inertia: Uncle Leiba sitting all day on a bench outside his house while &#x201c;his daughters browse like red cows&#x201d;; pale Aunt Mariassaja &#x201c;lies on the sofa. . .her body elongated, exhausted, her breasts sag&#x201d;; Uncle Judah &#x201c;is still on the stove, he seldom goes out&#x201d;; Uncle Israel &#x201c;is still sitting in his same place. . .warming himself, eyes closed, in front of the stove&#x201d;; only Uncle Neuch, with his cart and mare, immortalised in the painting <i>The Cattle Dealer,</i> did any work. This was the rural Russia of which the St. Petersburg bureaucrats and intellectuals despaired&#x2014;&#x201c;nowhere else in Europe can one find such incapacity for steady, moderate, measured work,&#x201d; wrote the nineteenth-century historian Vasilii Kliuchevskii&#x2014;but it was nonetheless full of sensuous colour and life. Feiga-Ita came to Vitebsk to marry twenty-three-year-old Khatskel (the Yiddish form of Ezekiel, translated into Russian as Zakhar, and abbreviated within the family to Hasha, Chaty, or Chazia) Shagal, a distant cousin whom she had never met; as was customary for Orthodox Jews of the time, it was an arranged marriage. Khatskel had left Lyozno not long before with his parents, David and Basheva, for the burgeoning city; he worked as a labourer at Jachnine&#x2019;s herring warehouse on the banks of the Dvina and lived near the town prison in the newcomers&#x2019; northern suburb of Peskovatik under the shadow of its seventeenth-century Holy Trinity Church, commonly known as &#x201c;the Black Trinity.&#x201d; His father, already in his sixties, scraped a living as a small-time teacher of religion to poor local boys. A fragile younger brother, Zussy, stayed behind in Lyozno, apprenticed to a hairdresser; unenterprising and childishly vain, he was the only one of the extended family later to take an interest in his nephew&#x2019;s paintings, though he declined to keep a portrait of himself, judging it insufficiently flattering.Peskovatik means &#x201c;in the sands,&#x201d; and the home where Feiga-Ita joined Khatskel was not so different from the country town she had just left. The roads were unpaved, frozen in the winter and full of muddy puddles in the summer; haphazardly built along them were wooden shacks with small backyards where chickens and goats scratched; cattle wandered on dirt tracks and into houses and shops, giving the area a rural appearance. Feiga-Ita milked goats in their yard, but even the wealthy Rosenfelds, Bella&#x2019;s parents, kept a cow in the courtyard beneath their apartment along with horses and chickens, and insisted that their servants feed the children fresh milk. When they went to a dacha for the summer, their cow trailed behind the wagons of provisions and bedding at the end of a rope. Even in the affluent part of Vitebsk, the countryside never seemed far away. Feiga-Ita and Khatskel, however, had no intention of staying in Peskovatik. Their wedding photograph shows a pair who typify the upwardly mobile, provincial-to-urban Jewish class of the time. Feiga-Ita stands neat and steady in tight-fitting black silk with high neck, long cuffs, ruches, and ribbons; she fixes the camera with a determined, lively gaze and clasps a book, though she was virtually illiterate. She looks sensible and practical; by the time of her wedding, she was already playing mother to her tribe of younger sisters. After her own marriage she would check out their fianc�s, travelling to neighbouring towns to inquire into their suitability, entering shops to pick up local gossip, peering through windows to keep informed, a step ahead of the game. Sitting at her side, broad-shouldered Khatskel in a kaftan-like greatcoat and peaked cap has the strength, beefiness, and taciturn expression of the focused young labourer; the gentle melancholy that was part of his character shines through too. Soon he became bent and permanently exhausted, defeated by his hard job and large family; at his wedding, however, his son claimed, &#x201c;my father had not been a poor young man. The photograph of him in his youth and my own observations of our wardrobe proved to me that when he married my mother he had a certain physical and financial authority, for he presented his fianc�e. . .with a magnificent shawl. Once married, he gave up turning his wages to his father and supported his own household.&#x201d; The splendid lace shawl appears in later photographs, but spirited, hopeful Feiga-Ita soon found that, despite shared aspirations and an unquestioning acceptance of a traditional religious way of life, Khatskel was not someone she could talk to. Feiga-Ita had more ambitious hopes and dreams than he could understand, and an energy that constantly sought new outlets. As a young mother, her intensity, and her loneliness within the marriage, as well as her naturally warm and kind-hearted nature, all unleashed in her a passion for her first child, Moyshe&#x2014;always known to his parents as Moshka, though listed by them on a family birth certificate as Movsha Khatskelev: Movsha (the Russian form of Moses), son of Khatskel. Born a year after his parents&#x2019; marriage, Chagall was lavished with unwavering adoration by Feiga-Ita until her death in 1915, and he saw Vitebsk as literally his mother town, his art rooted in his closeness to Feiga-Ita. &#x201c;If I have made pictures, it is because I remember my mother, her breasts so warmly nourishing and exalting me, and I feel I could swing from the moon,&#x201d; he recalled when he was seventy-nine. To his son-in-law Franz Meyer, he explained his art thus: &#x201c;It needs a withinness. An artist is tied to his mother&#x2019;s apron strings, humanly and formally obsessed by her closeness. Form derives not from academic teaching, but from this withinness.&#x201d; The dreaminess that fuelled his art, he knew, came from Feiga-Ita. &#x201c;Dreams, I am a dreamer&#x2014;I inherited my dreaminess from my mother&#x2014;this is true, and you, my dears, you don&#x2019;t even know what a <i>baba</i> I am,&#x201d; he told his sisters in a letter in 1912, when he was twenty-four. &#x201c;There is no one else in our family who so wants to know everything as me&#x2014;I am not praising myself here. . .I am interested in trivial things, don&#x2019;t judge me for that because I am a man.&#x201d; The love and identification between him and Feiga-Ita gave him a robustness and basic optimism and made him a survivor in life; it also lent him a vulnerability in his extreme dependence on women. A strikingly beautiful boy with curly hair and wide blue eyes, he remained Feiga-Ita&#x2019;s favourite of her nine children, and his unrivalled position was one he expected, unconsciously but uncompromisingly, to be replicated in every future relationship. A sister, named Chana after Feiga-Ita&#x2019;s mother, was born a year after him in 1888, but her arrival did not detract from the closeness of mother and son. In a family with just enough to go around, Feiga-Ita used to slip her firstborn extra snippets of food, strengthening him physically as well as emotionally; he lived longer than any of his siblings, only two of whom reached old age. Like most men who rise from obscurity to fame, Chagall mythologised his childhood. <i>My Life</i>, his memoir of his experiences in Russia, written when he was thirty-five and about to leave it forever, dwells at length on his early years in Vitebsk, and though some parts are romanticised and unreliable, many details are corroborated by factual sources, letters, and photographs, and the general tenor chimes with other memoirs of shtetl childhoods of the period. He opens with a drama: &#x201c;My mother told me I came into the world during a great fire and that the bed in which we were lying was moved from place to place to save us. Perhaps that is why I was always so agitated.&#x201d; The fire, one of many that swept through the wooden-built sections of Russian towns like Vitebsk, is documented for the day of his birth; the inhabitants usually fled to safety in the river. Chagall attributed his restlessness to these events of his birthday; as a child, he found the smoke and smouldering roofs and the flurry down to the Dvina exciting. The burning wooden houses in his paintings were a vivid recollection&#x2014;he saw, for example, the conflagration in 1904 of the ancient wooden Ilyinskaya Church close to his home; later they became, as well, a symbol of the destruction of Jewry. In 1887, however, his birthplace was saved. &#x201c;That little house near the Peskovatik road had not been touched,&#x201d; he wrote in 1922. &#x201c;The place reminds me of the bump on the head of the rabbi in green I painted, or of a potato tossed into a barrel of herring and soaked in pickling brine. Looking at this cottage from the height of my recent &#x2018;grandeur,&#x2019; I winced and I asked myself: &#x2018;How could I possibly have been born here? How does one breathe?&#x2019; &#x201d; He was, he says, born dead&#x2014;&#x201c;I did not want to live&#x201d;&#x2014;and was thrown into a trough of water to be revived; a trough lies at the foot of the bed in several paintings called <i>Birth</i>. The story hints at depression, passivity, resignation to fate, all characteristics he shared with his father and that were as fundamental as the instinct for survival and energy-bearing hope that he inherited from Feiga-Ita. A self-absorbed, soft-spoken, small child with a slim frame and delicate features, he grew up enveloped in the closed, exclusive atmosphere of Jewish Vitebsk. For his first thirteen years his was the&nbsp; tradition-bound upbringing of Orthodox eastern European Jewry, marked by strong family and community bonds, a modest, entirely religious education, poverty, and suspicion&#x2014;he used to hide under the bed whenever a policeman passed the window&#x2014;if the Christian world drew near. Even within the Pale of Settlement Jews did not have full civic rights; official policies were shaped by imperial advisers such as Konstantin Pobedonostsev, procurator of the Holy Synod under Alexander III, who suggested solving &#x201c;the Jewish problem&#x201d; by converting a third of the Jews, expelling a third, and killing a third.

But I have seen it very often.&#x201d; As these words make clear, Mother �Teresa&#x2019;s sensibility to the hungry is evident in the way she was moved by her direct contact with them. She was stirred in the depths of her heart by her encounter with those suffering real physical hunger, as is clear especially in the way she recounted the stories of her experiences with the hungry. These experiences began when she was a child. Her mother had accustomed her and her siblings to serve and look after people from the street. When she witnessed hunger (or any other need of the poor) her reaction was &#x201c;We have to do something about it.&#x201d; She then did anything possible (and at times also the nearly impossible) in order to bring food to the hungry. At times, she tried to literally &#x201c;move the world&#x201d; to provide food for those who were starving.<br><br>Hunger may be something that is remote from our experience or from our immediate surroundings. Maybe we &#x201c;meet&#x201d; the poor who suffer hunger only through the disturbing reports about some faraway disaster. However, if we &#x201c;open our eyes to see,&#x201d; as Mother Teresa challenges us to do, we might encounter many more people suffering from having their basic need for sustenance unmet.<br><br>Mother Teresa is known not for setting up great programs that resolve world hunger (worthy and necessary as they are) but for &#x201c;feeding the hungry,&#x201d; one by one, one at a time. Yet in doing so she made a great difference first in the lives of these individuals, and ultimately in the world.<br><br>There is another type of hunger that Mother Teresa began to speak of, especially after opening her houses in the West. She often repeated that people are &#x201c;not only hungry for bread but hungry for love.&#x201d; Though suffering from this need is not commonly referred to as poverty, she realized that this type of poverty was &#x201c;so much more difficult to remove.&#x201d; Thus it was also this &#x201c;hunger for love&#x201d; that she wanted to alleviate. She challenged her sisters, &#x201c;You are meant to be that love and compassion to the people here [in the West].&#x201d;<br><br>When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied, I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society&#x2014;that poverty is so hurtful and so much, and I find that very difficult. Our sisters are working amongst that kind of people in the West.<br><br>Finally, Mother Teresa found another type of hunger, in countries both poor and rich, among people of all classes and religious backgrounds. &#x201c;People are hungry for God,&#x201d; she used to say. This reality of &#x201c;spiritual hunger,&#x201d; which she experienced deeply and encountered wherever she went, she addressed in a simple and timely manner. She wanted to be &#x201c;God&#x2019;s love, His compassion, His presence&#x201d; wherever she went, so that people looking at her might come to know the God whom she wished to reflect.<br><br>HER WORDS<br><br>It&#x2019;s Because He Loved<br><br>Before [Jesus] taught the people, He had pity on the multitude, and He fed them. He made a miracle. He blessed the bread, and He fed five thousand people. It&#x2019;s because He loved the people. He had pity on them. He saw the hunger in their faces and He fed them. And only then He taught them.1<br><br>More than ever people want to see love in action through our humble works&#x2014;�how necessary it is for us to be in love with Jesus&#x2014;�to be able to feed Him in the hungry and the lonely. How pure our eyes and hearts must be to see Him in the poor. How clean our hands must be to touch Him in the poor with love and compassion. How clean our words must be to be able to proclaim the Good News to the poor.2<br><br>The Pain of Hunger<br><br>Some time ago one woman came with her child to me and said, &#x201c;Mother, I went to two, three places to beg some food, for we have not eaten for three days but they told me that I am young and I must work and eat. No one gave me anything.&#x201d; I went to get some food and by the time I returned the baby in her hand had died of hunger. I hope it was not our convents that refused her.3<br><br>We all speak of the terrible hunger. What I have seen in Ethiopia, what I have seen in other places, especially these days in places like Ethiopia, the people in hundreds and thousands are facing death just for [lack of] a piece of bread, for [lack of] a glass of water. People have died in my own hands. And yet we forget, why they and not we? Let us love again, so let us share, let us pray that this terrible suffering be removed from our people.4<br><br>The pain of hunger is terrible and that is where you and I must come and give until it hurts. I want you to give until it hurts. And this giving is love of God in action. Hunger is not only for bread, hunger is for love.5<br><br>The other day I picked up a child in Calcutta. From her dark eyes I saw she was hungry. And I gave her some bread and she was eating crumb by crumb. I told her, &#x201c;Eat the bread, you are hungry.&#x201d;6 I asked her why she eats so slowly. She replied: &#x201c;I am afraid to eat faster. When I finish this piece, soon I will be hungry again.&#x201d; I told her: &#x201c;Eat faster then I will give you more.&#x201d; That small child already knows the pain of hunger. &#x201c;I am afraid.&#x201d; See&#x2014;�we don&#x2019;t know. As you can see we do not know what hunger is. We do not know how it is to feel pain because of hunger. I have seen small children dying for [lack of] a cup of milk. I have seen mothers in awful pain because children were dying in their own hands out of hunger. Don&#x2019;t forget! I am not asking for money. I want you to give of your sacrifice. I want you to sacrifice something you like, something you would like to have for yourself. . . . One day a very poor lady came to our house. She said: &#x201c;Mother, I want to help but I am very poor. I am going from house to house to wash other people&#x2019;s clothes every day. I need to feed my children, but I want to do something. Please, let me come every Saturday to wash your children&#x2019;s clothes for a half an hour.&#x201d; This woman gave me more than thousands of rupees because she has given me her heart completely.7<br><br>This morning I went to see the cardinal of Marseille, who is in charge of Cor Unum, to ask [them] to send food for our people in Africa. There is great poverty in Africa. The other day our sisters wrote that the people just come in front of our gate for food and many of them died of hunger. If the situation continues like now, many are in danger of death; children are dying in the arms of their mothers&#x2014;�what a terrible suffering. So I went to this cardinal to ask if he could send some food to our sisters. He was very nice; he told me that until our sisters went, they were not aware of the presence of the poor.8<br><br>Love, to Be True, Has to Hurt<br><br>I had the most extraordinary experience of love of neighbor with a Hindu family. A gentleman came to our house and said, &#x201c;Mother Teresa, there is a family who has not eaten for so long. Do something.&#x201d; So I took some rice and went there immediately. And I saw the children&#x2014;�their eyes shining with hunger. I don&#x2019;t know if you have ever seen hunger, but I have seen it very often. And the mother of the family took the rice I gave her and went out. When she came back I asked her, &#x201c;Where did you go; what did you do?&#x201d; And she gave me a very simple answer: &#x201c;They [a Muslim family]are hungry also.&#x201d; What struck me most that she knew, and who are they? A Muslim family. And she knew. And I did not bring any more rice that evening because I wanted them&#x2014;�Hindus and Muslims&#x2014;�to enjoy the joy of sharing. But there were those children radiating joy, sharing their joy and peace with their mother because she had the love to give until it hurts, and you see this is where love begins&#x2014;�at home in the family.9<br><br>Love, to be true, has to hurt and this woman who was hungry&#x2014;�she knew that her neighbor was also hungry, and that family happened to be a Mohammedan family. So it was so touching, so real. This is where we are most unjust to our poor&#x2014;�we don&#x2019;t know them. We don&#x2019;t know them&#x2014;�how great they are, how lovable they are, how hungry they are for that understanding love.10<br><br>We have another word, free. I cannot charge anything for the work I do. People criticize us and say ugly things because of this word, free. The other day I read in one article, written by [a priest], that charity is like a drug for the poor&#x2014;�that when we give the people things free, it is like giving them drugs. I&#x2019;ve decided that I will write to him and ask him: &#x201c;Why did Jesus have pity on the people?&#x201d; He must have drugged them also when He fed them by the multiplication of the loaves and fishes. He came to give Good News to the people but when He saw that they were hungry and tired, He fed them first. One more question that I&#x2019;m going to ask him, &#x201c;Did you ever feel the hunger of the poor?&#x201d;11<br><br>You know we cook for thousands of people in Calcutta. It happened one day that a sister came to me and said, &#x201c;Mother, we have nothing to cook.&#x201d; It had never happened before. Then, at nine o&#x2019;clock a truck arrived, full of bread. The government had closed the schools for the day and sent us the bread. See again, God&#x2019;s concern. He even closed the schools, but He would not let the hungry ones die&#x2014;�that tenderness and concern of God.12<br><br>We Want to Serve<br><br>The other day a Gujarati family came to Dum Dum13 where we have crippled people and undernourished children and TB patients. This family, the whole family, came with cooked food. Once upon a time people would never think of going near to these people. When they came I told the sisters to go and help them in the serving. [To] my surprise they said, &#x201c;Mother, we want to serve by ourselves.&#x201d; For them it is a great thing, for they become unclean. This is our privilege. Some of them were even old. Nothing prevented them; unbelievable for a Hindu family to say and to do such things.14<br><br>Together, We Can Do Something Beautiful for God<br><br>Love is for today; programs are for the future. We are for today; when tomorrow will come we shall see what we can do. Somebody is thirsty for water for today, hungry for food for today. Tomorrow we will not have them if we don&#x2019;t feed them today. So be concerned with what you can do today.15<br><br>I never get mixed up in what governments should or should not do. Instead of spending time [on] those questions I say, &#x201c;let me do [something] now.&#x201d; Tomorrow may never come&#x2014;�our people may be dead by tomorrow. So today they need a slice of bread and a cup of tea; I give it to them today. Somebody was finding fault with the work and said, &#x201c;Why do you always give them the fish to eat? Why don&#x2019;t you give them the rod to catch the fish?&#x201d; So I said, &#x201c;Our people, they cannot even stand properly on account of hunger and disease, still less, would they be able to hold a rod to catch the fish. But I will keep on giving them the fish to eat and when they are strong enough and they can stand on their feet, I will hand them over to you and you give them the rod to catch the fish.&#x201d; And I think this is the sharing. This is where we need each other. It&#x2019;s where what we can do, you may not be able to do. But what you can do, we cannot do. But if we put these two works together, there can be something beautiful for God.16<br><br>The other day again, a group of Hindu schoolchildren came from very far. All the first and second prize-�winners went and asked the headmistress to give the money instead of the prizes. So she put all the money in an envelope and gave it to them. Then they all asked: &#x201c;Now take us to Mother Teresa: we want to give the money to her poor people.&#x201d; Now see how wonderful it was that they did not use that money for themselves. Because we have created this awareness, the whole world wants to share with the poor. Whenever I accept money or an award or anything, I always take it in the name of the poor, whom they recognize in me. I think I am right, because after all what am I? I am nothing. It is the poor whom they recognize in me that they want to give to, because they see what we do. Today people in the world want to see.17<br><br>Tremendous Hunger for Love<br><br>In Ethiopia and in India hundreds of people are coming and dying just there for [lack of] a piece of bread. In Rome and London and places like that people die of loneliness and bitterness.18<br><br>You see, we have a wrong idea that only hunger for bread is hunger. There is much greater hunger and much more painful hunger: hunger for love, for the feeling of being wanted, to be somebody to somebody. A feeling of being unwanted, unloved, rejected. I think that&#x2019;s a very great hunger and very great poverty.19<br><br>We have houses all over Europe and the United States and other places where there is no hunger for a piece of bread. But there&#x2019;s a tremendous hunger for love, a feeling of being unwanted, unloved, shut in, rejected, forgotten. There are people who have forgotten what is a human smile, what is a human touch. I think that is very, very great poverty. . . . And it is very difficult to remove that poverty while [satisfying that] hunger for a piece of bread, or nakedness for a piece of cloth, for a home made of bricks . . . , I think that&#x2019;s the much greater poverty, much greater disease, much greater painful situation of today.20<br><br>Another time I was walking through the streets of London in a poor area where our sisters also work. I saw a man in a truly terrible condition sitting there looking so sad and alone. So I walked up to him and took him by the hand and asked him how he was. When I did this he looked up at me and said, &#x201c;Oh, after such a long time, I feel the warmth of a human hand. After such a long time, someone is touching me.&#x201d; And then his eyes brightened, and he started to sit up straight. Such a tiny attention had brought Jesus into his life. He had been waiting so long for a show of human love, but it was actually a show of God&#x2019;s love. These are beautiful examples of the hunger I see in these people, the poorest of the poor, the ignorant and unwanted, the unloved, the rejected, and the forgotten. They are hungry for God. This is something you priests must meet continually; not only a hunger in people suffering physically, but also a great hunger in people suffering spiritually and emotionally&#x2014;�people suffering in their hearts and souls, especially young people.21<br><br>Terrible Hunger for the Word of God<br><br>&#x201c;Where is that hunger in our country?&#x201d; Yes, there is hunger. Maybe not the hunger for a piece of bread, but there is a terrible hunger for love. There is a terrible hunger for the word of God. I will never forget when we went to Mexico, and we went visiting very poor families. And those people we saw had scarcely anything in their homes, and yet nobody asked for anything. They all asked us: &#x201c;Teach us the word of God. Give us the word of God.&#x201d; They were hungry for the word of God. Here, too, in the whole world there is a hunger for God, among the young especially. And it is there that we must find Jesus and satisfy that hunger.22<br><br>HER EXAMPLE: The Testimonies<br><br>We Carried Food on Our Heads and Waded Through the Water<br><br>In 1968 there was a big flood in Calcutta. We went in our truck at night to give food to the people affected by the flood in Tiljala. We carried food on our heads and waded through the water. At one moment the flood current almost carried Sr. Agnes away and so we sent her back to the truck. We were drenched to the skin and freezing. When we returned home at three a.m. Mother was waiting for us at the gate. She had kept hot water for all of us to bathe and a nice strong cup of hot coffee to make us warm. We were very touched by Mother&#x2019;s tender loving care for us her children.23<br><br>Filling the Measuring Container Full and Pressing<br><br>Mo...</p><h2>Mr. Zero</h2><p>When Gay Harkwicke and her fiance+a7, Algy, investigate the mysterious Mr. Zero, who is blackmailing Gay&#39;s cousin, Algy ends up becoming the prime suspect in a messy murder, and Gay must find the true culprit.

For every General Electric&#x2013;still going strong after more than one hundred years&#x2013;there are dozens of businesses like Central Leather, which was one of the world&#x2019;s largest companies in 1912 but was liquidated in 1952. Ormerod debunks conventional economic theory&#x2013;that the world economy ticks along in perfect equilibrium according to the best-laid plans of business and government&#x2013;and delves into the reasons for the failure of brands, entire companies, and public policies. Inspired by recent advances in evolutionary theory and biology, Ormerod illuminates the ways in which companies and policy-setting sectors of government behave much like living organisms: unless they evolve, they die. But he also makes clear how desirable social and economic outcomes may be achieved when individuals, companies and governments adapt in response to the actual behavior and requirements of their customers and constituents.<br><br><i>Why Most Things Fail</i> is a fascinating and provocative study of a truth all too seldom acknowledged.</p><p>Failure is the most fundamental feature ofbiological, social and economic systems. Just as species fail--and become extinct--so do companies, brands and public policies. And while failure may be hard to handle, understanding the pervasive nature of failure in the world of human societies and economies is essential for those looking to succeed. <p>Linking economic models with models of biological evolution, Why Most Things Fail identifies the subtle patterns that comprise the apparent disorder of failure and analyzes why failure arises. Throughout the book, author Paul Ormerod exposes the flaws in some of today's most basic economic assumptions, and examines how professionals in both business and government can help their organizations survive and thrive in a world that has become too complex. Along the way, Ormerod discusses how the Iron Law of Failure applies to business and government, and reveals how you can achieve optimal social and economic outcomes by properly adapting to a world characterized by constant change, evolution and disequilibrium. </p><p>Filled with in-depth insight, expert advice and illustrative examples, Why Most Things Fail will show you why failure is so common and what you can do to become one of the few who succeed.</p><b>Paul Ormerod</b> was the head of the Economic Assessment Unit at <i>The Economist</i> and the director of economics at the Henley Centre for Forecasting in England.

Though there are between 2 and 8 million Muslims in the USA, Islam has traditionally had little political clout compared to other minority faiths. Nonetheless it is believed to be the country&#39;s fastest-growing religion, with a vibrant culture of theological debate, particularly regarding the role of women preachers. In Islam in America, Jonathan Curiel traces the story of America&#39;s Muslims from the seventeenth-century slave trade to the eighteenth-century immigration wave to the Nation of Islam. Drawing on interviews in communities from industrial Michigan to rural California, Curiel portrays the diversity of practices, cultures and observances that make up Muslim America. He profiles the leading personalities and institutions representing the community, and explores their relationship to the wider politics of America, particularly after 9/11. Islam in America offers an indispensable guide to the social life of modern Islam and the diversity of contemporary America.</p><p>Jonathan Curiel is a former staff writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, whose work has also appeared in the Columbia Journalism Review, Salon.com and the LA Times. He is the author of Al America: Travels through America&#39;s Arab and Islamic Roots. Malise Ruthven is one of the world&#39;s leading commentators on Islam, about which he has published numerous books. He is a regular contributor to the New York Review of Books.'Islam in America offers a remarkably original and readable narrative of the history of Islam &amp; Muslims in America. Jonathan Curiel here reveals a side of American Muslim culture that is as old as America itself.' Jamal Dajani, independent journalist-host, Arab Talk Radio; 'So many years after 9/11, the gulf between Muslims and non-Muslims in the United States remains depressingly wide. We still need a much better and more nuanced understanding of Islam, especially after the tragic events in Paris. Jonathan Curiel is therefore to be commended for giving us this closely-argued and highly readable book which - as both labor of love and much needed antidote to prejudice and misunderstanding - is intended to close the gap.' Akbar Ahmed, Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies and Professor of International Relations, American University, Washington, DC, and formerly High Commissioner of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in the United Kingdom and Ireland; 'Finally, an ethically disinterested observer's clear, concise, and comprehensive survey of the American Muslim community. Islam in America is a fascinating and long overdue book about the faith and its followers that have been part of the tapestry of America from its inception.'

The traditional therapeutic model sets its sights on the past, but Phil Stutz and Barry Michels employ an arsenal of techniques&#x2014;&#x201c;the tools&#x201d;&#x2014;that allow patients to use their problems as levers that access the power of the unconscious and propel them into action. Suddenly, through this transformative approach, obstacles become opportunities&#x2014;to find courage, embrace discipline, develop self-expression, deepen creativity. <br>&nbsp;<br>For years, Stutz and Michels taught these techniques to an exclusive patient base, but with <i>The Tools,</i> their revolutionary, empowering practice becomes available to every reader interested in realizing the full range of their potential.

[Stutz and Michels] have developed a program designed to access the creative power of the unconscious.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></b></p><p><strong>A Letter from the Authors: What Is a Tool?</strong> <br> In conventional psychotherapy, we talk about &#x201c;insights&#x201d; or &#x201c;causation&#x201d; and we tend to believe that if we can uncover the deep-seated reasons behind someone&#x2019;s problems, then the person will change automatically. This implies that awareness alone creates the forces that cause change. But real change, the kind of change patients in therapy cry out for, means changing your behavior, not just your attitude. <p>That requires much stronger forces. A tool is a technique or procedure that can generate a force that allows you to do the work of change. It is work that must be done in real time. When do we use a tool? In the present.</p> <p>Conventional therapy tends to be passive and focuses on the past. It excavates a patient&#x2019;s history, usually from childhood, brings it into the light of day and interprets it so as to strip it of its unconscious power. I have the greatest respect for the past. Memories, emotions, insights can all be very valuable. But my patients needed help and relief in the present and all the insights in the world weren&#x2019;t going to be powerful enough to deliver that.</p> <p>To control your actions you need something else: a specific procedure you can use systematically to combat a specific problem -- you need a tool.</p> <p>There&#x2019;s an obvious objection that arises here: Isn&#x2019;t what you&#x2019;re doing superficial? Sure, these tools of yours may help a patient change his or her behavior but you haven&#x2019;t addressed the underlying reasons. Unless you do that they&#x2019;re bound to go back to their (self-) destructive ways sooner or later.</p> <p>There are two answers to this objection. The first involves a misunderstanding of how people change. Insight into the &#x201c;reasons&#x201d; for a problem isn&#x2019;t the cause of change &#x2013; it&#x2019;s the result. Groups like Alcoholics Anonymous have always known this. You don&#x2019;t join AA and then sit around discussing why you drink too much over a few beers or vodka martinis. You join to stop drinking one day at a time. Only after that can you look into the roots of your addiction by &#x201c;taking inventory.&#x201d;</p> <p>The second answer goes back to our original question about what a tool is. There has been a bias in psychotherapy implying that anything that is active and involves your will is superficial; as if the deepest part of human experience can only occur inside your head. The truth is the opposite; the deepest part of human experience happens when you interact with the world outside yourself. That means you need to go beyond thinking and into &#x201c;doing&#x201d;&#x2014;and this is exactly what a tool makes possible.</p> <p></p><b>Phil Stutz</b> graduated from City College in New York and received his MD from New York University.

From the moment she lays eyes on this stunning male, Gabby is certain of one thing: He could be her undoing. Thus begins a long, dangerous seduction. Because despite his powerful strength and unquenchable hungers, Adam refuses to take a woman by force. Instead, he will tease his way into Gabby&#x2019;s bed and make her want him just as he wants her. <br><br>Now, no matter how hard Gabby tries to avoid him, Adam is everywhere, invisible to all but her&#x2014;perched atop her office cubicle in too-tight jeans, whispering softly from behind the stacks of the law library, stealing her breath away with his knowing smile...all the while tempting her with the promise of unimaginable pleasure in his arms.

Shrugging out of her suit jacket, she nudged off her heels and took slow, deep breaths. She sat collecting herself for a few moments, then tugged free the clip restraining her hair and massaged her scalp.<br><br>She was getting the start of a killer headache.<br><br>And her hands were still shaking.<br><br>She&#x2019;d nearly betrayed herself to the Fae.<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t believe she&#x2019;d been so stupid, but, God, there were just too many of them this summer! She hadn&#x2019;t spotted a fairy in Cincinnati for years, but now, for some bizarre reason, there were oodles of them.<br><br>Like Cincinnati was some kind of great place to hang out&#x2014;could a city be more boring? Whatever their unfathomable reason for choosing the Tri-State, they&#x2019;d appeared in droves in early June, and had been ruining her summer ever since.<br><br>And pretending she didn&#x2019;t see them never got any easier. With their perfect bodies, gold-velvet skin, and shimmering iridescent eyes, they were a little hard to miss. Drop-dead gorgeous, impossibly seductive, dripping pure power, the males were a walking temptation for a girl to&#x2014;<br><br>Brusquely she shook her head to abort that treacherous thought. She&#x2019;d survived this long and was darned if she was going to slip up and get caught by one of the erotic&#x2014;exotic, she corrected herself impatiently&#x2014;creatures.<br><br>But sometimes it was so hard not to look at them. And doubly difficult not to react. Especially when one caught her off guard like the last one had.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been having lunch with Marian Temple, senior partner at the law firm of Temple, Turley and Tucker, at a posh downtown restaurant; a very critical lunch, during which she&#x2019;d been interviewing for a postgraduate position.<br><br>A soon-to-be-third-year law student, Gabby was serving a summer internship with Little &amp; Staller, a local firm of personal injury attorneys. It had taken her all of two days on the job to realize she was not cut out for representing pushy, med-bill-inflating plaintiffs who were firmly convinced their soft-tissue injuries were worth at least a million dollars per ache.<br><br>At the opposite end of the legal spectrum was Temple, Turley and Tucker. The most prestigious firm in the city, it catered to only the most desirable clients, specializing in business law and estate planning. What carefully selected criminal cases they chose to represent were renowned, precedent-setting ones. Ones that made a difference in the world, protecting fundamental rights and addressing intolerable injustices. And those were the cases she hungered to get her hands on. Even if she had to slave away for years, doing research and fetching coffee to get to them.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been stressed all week, anticipating the interview, knowing that TT&amp;T hired only the cream of the crop. Knowing she was competing against dozens of her classmates, not to mention dozens more from law schools around the country, in a cutthroat bid for a single opening. Knowing Marian Temple had a reputation for demanding nothing less than high-gloss sophistication and professional perfection.<br><br>But thanks to hours of aggressive practice interviews and pep talks from her best friend, Elizabeth, Gabby had been calm, composed, and in top form. The aloof Ms. Temple had been impressed with her scholastic achievements, and Gabby had gotten the distinct impression that the firm was predisposed to hire a woman (couldn&#x2019;t be too careful with those equal-opportunity statistics), which put her ahead of most of the competition. The lunch had gone swimmingly, until the moment they&#x2019;d left the restaurant and stepped out onto Fifth Street.<br><br>As Ms. Temple was extending that all-important invitation to come in for a second, in-house interview with the partners (which was never arranged unless the firm was seriously considering making an offer, joy of joys!), a sexy, muscle-bound fairy male sauntered right between them in that infuriatingly arrogant I&#x2019;m-so-perfect, don&#x2019;t-you-just-wish-you-were-me way they had, so close that its long golden hair brushed Gabby&#x2019;s cheek like a sensual ripple of silk.<br><br>The intoxicating fragrance of jasmine and sandalwood surrounded her, and the heat radiating off its powerful body caressed her like a sultry, erotic breeze. It took every ounce of her considerable self-discipline to not inch backward out of its way.<br><br>Or worse&#x2014;yield to that incessant temptation and just pet the gorgeous tawny creature. How many times had she dreamed of doing that? Copping one tiny forbidden fairy-feel. Finally finding out if all that golden fairy skin really felt as velvety as it looked. You must never betray that you can see them, Gabby.<br><br>Thoroughly discombobulated by the fairy&#x2019;s proximity, her suddenly nerveless hand lost its grip on the iced coffee she&#x2019;d taken from the restaurant in a to-go cup. It hit the sidewalk, the top flew off, and coffee exploded upward, drenching the impeccable Ms. Temple.<br><br>At that precise moment, the fairy turned back to look at her, its iridescent eyes narrowing.<br><br>Panicked, Gabby focused all her attention on the sputtering Ms. Temple. With the enthusiasm of near-hysteria, she plucked tissues from her purse and dabbed frantically at the spreading coffee stains on what had been, moments before, a pristine ivory suit that she had a sick feeling cost more than she made in a month.<br><br>Babbling loudly about how clumsy she was, apologizing and blaming everything from eating too much, to not being used to heels, to being nervous about the interview, in a matter of moments, she managed to completely blow the image of cool, composed confidence she&#x2019;d so painstakingly projected through lunch.<br><br>But she&#x2019;d had no choice.<br><br>In order to make the fairy believe she hadn&#x2019;t seen it, that she was just a clumsy human, nothing more, she&#x2019;d had to act like a complete spaz and risk sabotaging her credibility with her prospective employer.<br><br>Sabotage it, she had.<br><br>Swatting away Gabby&#x2019;s frantically dabbing hands, Ms. Temple smoothed her ruined suit and huffed off toward her car, pausing to toss stiffly over her shoulder, &#x201c;As I told you earlier, Ms. O&#x2019;Callaghan, our firm works with only the highest caliber clients. They can be demanding, excessive, and temperamental. And understandably so. When there are millions at stake, a client has every right to expect the best. We at Temple, Turley and Tucker pride ourselves on being unflappable under stress. Our clients require smooth, sophisticated handling. Frankly, Ms. O&#x2019;Callaghan, you&#x2019;re too flighty to be successful with our firm. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll find an appropriate fit elsewhere. Good day, Ms. O&#x2019;Callaghan.&#x201d;<br><br>Feeling like she&#x2019;d been kicked in the stomach, Gabby watched in stricken silence as Ms. Temple accepted her spotless Mercedes from the valet, dimly registering that the fairy, blessedly, was also moving on. As the sleek pearl-colored Mercedes merged onto Fifth Street and disappeared into traffic&#x2014;the job of her dreams flapping farewell on its tailpipe&#x2014;Gabby&#x2019;s shoulders slumped. With a gusty sigh, she turned and trudged down the street to the corner lot where simple law students not-destined-for-success-because-they-were-too-flighty could afford to park.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Flighty,&#x2019; my ass,&#x201d; she muttered, resting her head on the steering wheel. &#x201c;You have no idea what my life is like. You can&#x2019;t see them.&#x201d;<br><br>All Ms. Temple had probably felt was a slight breeze, a moderate increase in temperature, perhaps caught a whiff of an exotic, arousing fragrance. And if, by chance, the fairy had brushed against her&#x2014;although they were invisible, they were real, and were actually there&#x2014;Ms. Temple would have rationalized it away somehow. Those who couldn&#x2019;t see the Fae always did.<br><br>Gabby had learned the hard way that people had zero tolerance for the inexplicable. It never ceased to amaze her what flimsy excuses they dredged up to protect their perception of reality. &#x201c;Gee, I guess I didn&#x2019;t get enough sleep last night.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Wow, I shouldn&#x2019;t have had that second (or third or fourth) beer with lunch.&#x201d; If all else failed, they settled for a simple &#x201c;I must have imagined it.&#x201d;<br><br>How she longed for such oblivion!<br><br>She shook her head and tried to console herself with the thought that at least the fairy had been convinced and was gone. She was safe. For now.<br><br>The way Gabby figured it, the Fae were responsible for ninety-nine percent of the problems in her life. She&#x2019;d take responsibility for the other one percent, but they were the reason her life this summer had been one crisis after another. They were the reason she&#x2019;d begun to dread leaving her house, never knowing where one might pop up, or how badly it might startle her. Or what kind of ass she&#x2019;d make of herself, trying to regroup. They were the reason her boyfriend had broken up with her fifteen days, three hours, and&#x2014;she glanced broodingly at her watch&#x2014;forty-two minutes ago.<br><br>Gabrielle O&#x2019;Callaghan harbored a special and very personal hatred for the Fae.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see you. I don&#x2019;t see you,&#x201d; she muttered beneath her breath as two mouthwatering fairy males strolled past the hood of her car. She averted her gaze, caught herself, then angled the rearview mirror and pretended to be fussing with her lipstick.<br><br>Never look away too sharply, her grandmother, Moira O&#x2019;Callaghan, had always cautioned. You must act natural. You must learn to let your gaze slide over them without either hitching or pulling away too abruptly, or they&#x2019;ll know you know.

An award- winning writer, she is the author of three critically acclaimed novels-in-verse, has coedited Granta�&#x2019;s <i>New Writing 15</i>, and has written for a wide variety of print, radio, and media including <i>The Guardian, Times</i> (London), <i>BOMB</i> magazine, and the BBC. The recipient of several awards, most recently a NESTA Fellowship Award, Evaristo is a fellow of Britain�&#x2019;s Royal Society of Literature as well as of the Royal Society of Arts.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Ron Charles My only complaint about Bernardine Evaristo's alternate history of racial slavery is that it's 150 years late. Imagine the outrage this clever novel would have provoked alongside Harriet Beecher Stowe's incendiary story or Frederick Douglass's memoir! But now, amid the warm glow of 21st-century liberalism, with our brilliant black president, what could we possibly learn from a new satire of slavery? Plenty. Blonde Roots turns the whole world on its nappy head, and you'll be surprised how different it looks -- and how similar. In the reverse-image past that Evaristo imagines, civilized Africans have built a vibrant culture and economy by capturing primitive Europeans and using them as slaves. This ingenious bit of "what-if" speculation provides the backdrop for a thrilling adventure about a "whyte" woman named Doris Scagglethorpe who works as a "house wigger" for Chief Kaga Konata Katamba. (She's branded with his initials: KKK.) The story dashes off the first page as Doris makes her escape during the annual celebration of Voodoomass. Recapture could mean death by torture for "the crimes of Ungratefulness and Dishonesty," but she's done waiting for freedom. "Deep down I knew that the slave traders were never going to give up their cash cow," Doris tells us. "It was, after all, one of the most lucrative international businesses ever, involving the large-scale transport of whytes, shipped in our millions from the continent of Europe to the West Japanese Islands, so called because when the 'great' explorer and adventurer Chinua Chikwuemeka was trying to find a new route to Asia, he mistook those islands for the legendary isles of Japan, and the name stuck." Historical anachronisms along with a weirdly distorted geography contribute to the novel's through-the-looking-glass atmosphere. As a rare literate slave, Doris enjoys a privileged position in her master's house, but she snatches a chance to ride Londolo's Underground Railroad -- the city's abandoned subway system -- out of the glamorous "Chocolate City" and into the seedy "Vanilla Suburbs." As we follow her perilous escape, Doris tells us how she was abducted from a poor English cabbage farm where she lived with her parents. She describes the gruesome Middle Passage, during which half her fellow captives expire or are murdered; the vicissitudes of the slave market, where traumatized family members are sold off in different directions; and the rape and humiliation that keep whyte people laboring on the sugar cane plantations. This is, in other words, a story whose basic elements we already know from Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Stowe, Alex Haley, Toni Morrison and others whom Evaristo alludes to throughout Blonde Roots, but even the most colorblind readers will be unsettled by seeing these horrors with the colors reversed. As always, the values of the dominant culture reflect its power structure; the black master's body and attitudes are the desired norm, even the ideal. "Privacy was a foreign concept to all Aphrikans," Doris says. "They said that the Europane need for solitude was further proof of our inferior culture." An expert explains that "over millennia, the capacious skull of the Negroid has been able to accommodate the growth of a very large brain within its structure. This has enabled a highly sophisticated intelligence to evolve." Are you listening, James Watson? Standards of attractiveness are similarly upended. Whyte people try to tan themselves into black beauties, and those who can afford it have surgery to flatten their noses. After giving Doris a proper name -- "Omorenomwara" -- her African owner expects her to look respectable, which means wearing her straight blonde hair in plaited hoops all over her head and going barefoot. And topless. As a "fully paid up member of the most loathed race in the history of the world," Doris admits that she has "image issues." Every morning she secretly repeats affirmations that some whyte Steve Biko must have preached: "I may be fair and flaxen. I may have slim nostrils and slender lips. I may have oil-rich hair and a non-rotund bottom. I may blush easily, go rubicund in the sun and have covert yet mentally alert blue eyes. Yes, I may be whyte. But I am whyte and I am beautiful!" The daughter of an English mother and a Nigerian father, Evaristo is a poet whose previous three novels were written in verse. This time, although she's writing in the colloquial speech of her narrator, she's still extremely attentive to the function of language, the power of words to shape reality. Blonde Roots is spiked with witty cultural references that detail the pervasiveness of racism. As she flees, Doris passes advertisements for "Guess Who's Not Coming to Dinner" and "To Sir With Hate." She describes popular minstrel shows in which performers in whyte-face "sang out of tune in reedy voices, their upper lips stiff as they danced with idiotic, jerky movements . . . singing music hall songs about being lazy, lying, conniving, cowardly, ignorant, sexually repressed buffoons." Evaristo has even reversed the dialects, forcing us to struggle with the plantation whytes' thick patois the way we have to wade through the Nigger Jim's speech in Huck Finn: "Sundays him carve tings fe folk in de quarter an don't charge nuttin but just aks to join famlees fer dinner." Trying to cheer themselves, the slaves sing the old spirituals of their homeland: "Shud ole akwaintaince be forget/ An neva bring to mind/ Should ole akwaintance be forget/ An ole lang zine." In the middle of Blonde Roots, Evaristo drops in a 50-page essay written by Doris's owner: a "modest &amp; truthful" defense of "The True Nature of the Slave Trade." It's a masterful bit of satire, with a sarcastic nod to Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Breathtaking in its self-pity, self-justification and self-satisfaction, this faux memoir is full of the scientific rationales, cultural insights and moral gymnastics that buttressed 19th-century slavery and remain handy for justifying 21st-century liberations of less civilized nations. In a moving final section that keeps the excitement pounding till the last page, Doris describes the devastating effects of racism on whyte families: fathers turning violent and oversexed; young men devolving into thugs and ignoring the noble models of their ancestors; women working to death, raising children they know they'll soon lose. The whole story is a riotous, bitter course in the arbitrary nature of our cultural values. Don't be fooled; slavery might have ended 150 years ago, but you've still got time to be enlightened by this bracing novel. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Mimi Spencer is a feature-writer and columnist for publications including the Mail and the Evening Standard.FastDiet Introduction<p></p> <br>OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES, food fads have come and gone, but the standard medical advice on what constitutes a healthy lifestyle has stayed much the same: eat low-fat foods, exercise more . . . and never, ever skip meals. Over that same period, levels of obesity worldwide have soared.<br> <br>Now many of those old certainties are being questioned.<br> <br>There is nothing else you can do to your body that is as powerful as fasting.<br> <br>When we first read about the benefits of intermittent fasting, we, like many, were skeptical. Fasting seemed drastic, difficult&#x2014;and we both knew that dieting of any description is generally doomed to fail. But now that we&#x2019;ve looked at it in depth and tried it ourselves, we are convinced of its remarkable potential. As one of the medical experts interviewed for this book puts it: &#x201c;There is nothing else you can do to your body that is as powerful as fasting.&#x201d;<br> Fasting: An Ancient Idea, a Modern Method<p></p> <br>Fasting is nothing new. As we&#x2019;ll discover in the next chapter, your body is designed to fast. We evolved at a time when food was scarce; we are the product of millennia of feast or famine. The reason we respond so well to intermittent fasting may be because it mimics, far more accurately than three meals a day, the environment in which modern humans were shaped.<br> <br>Fasting, of course, remains an article of faith for many. The fasts of Lent, Yom Kippur, and Ramadan are just some of the better-known examples. Greek Orthodox Christians are encouraged to fast for 180 days of the year (according to Saint Nikolai of Zicha, &#x201c;Gluttony makes a man gloomy and fearful, but fasting makes him joyful and courageous&#x201d;), while Buddhist monks fast on the new moon and full moon of each lunar month.<br> <br>Many more of us, however, seem to be eating most of the time. We&#x2019;re rarely ever hungry. But we are dissatisfied. With our weight, our bodies, our health.<br> <br>Intermittent fasting can put us back in touch with our human selves. It is a route not only to weight loss, but also to long-term health and well-being. Scientists are only just beginning to discover and prove how powerful a tool it can be.<br> <br>A review article recently published in the scientific journal Cell Metabolism, &#x201c;Fasting: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Applications,&#x201d;1 which looked at some of the most recent human and animal studies, makes the point that &#x201c;fasting has been practiced for millennia, but only recently, studies have shed light on its role in adaptive cellular responses that reduce oxidative damage and inflammation, optimize energy metabolism, and bolster cellular protection.&#x201d;<br> <br>In other words, we now know, through proper scientific studies, that fasting reduces many of the things that promote aging (&#x201c;oxidative damage and inflammation&#x201d;), while increasing the body&#x2019;s ability to protect and repair itself (&#x201c;cellular protection&#x201d;).<br> <br>The article concludes that fasting &#x201c;helps reduce obesity, hypertension, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, fasting has the potential to delay aging and help prevent and treat diseases.&#x201d;<br> <br>This book is a product of cutting-edge scientific research and its impact on our current thinking about weight loss, disease resistance, and longevity. But it is also the result of our personal experiences.<br> <br>Both are relevant here&#x2014;the lab and the lifestyle&#x2014;so we investigate intermittent fasting from two complementary perspectives. First, Michael, who used his body and medical training to test its potential, explains the scientific foundations of intermittent fasting (IF) and the 5:2 diet&#x2014;something he brought to the world&#x2019;s attention during the summer of 2012.<br> <br>Then Mimi offers a practical guide on how to do it safely, effectively, and in a sustainable way, a way that will fit easily into your normal everyday life. She looks in detail at how fasting feels, what you can expect from day to day, what to eat, and when to eat, and provides a host of tips and strategies to help you gain the greatest benefit from the diet&#x2019;s simple precepts.<br> <br>As you&#x2019;ll see below, the FastDiet has changed both of our lives. We hope it will do the same for you.<br> Michael&#x2019;s Motivation: A Male Perspective<p></p> <br>I am a 57-year-old male, and before I embarked on my exploration of intermittent fasting, I was mildly overweight: at five feet, eleven inches, I weighed around 187 pounds and had a body mass index of 26, which put me into the overweight category. Until my midthirties, I had been slim, but like many people I then gradually put on weight, around one pound a year. This doesn&#x2019;t sound like much, but over a couple of decades it pushed me up and up. Slowly I realized that I was starting to resemble my father, a man who struggled with weight all his life and died in his early seventies of complications associated with diabetes. At his funeral many of his friends commented on how like him I had become.<br> <br>While making a documentary for the BBC, I was fortunate enough to have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan done. This revealed that I am a TOFI&#x2014;thin on the outside, fat inside. This visceral fat is the most dangerous sort of fat, because it wraps itself around your internal organs and puts you at risk for heart disease and diabetes. I later had blood tests that showed I was heading toward diabetes, and had a cholesterol score that was also way too high. Obviously, I was going to have to do something about this. I tried following standard advice, except it made little difference. My weight and blood profile remained stuck in the &#x201c;danger ahead&#x201d; zone.<br> <br>I had never tried dieting before because I&#x2019;d never found a diet that I thought would work. I&#x2019;d watched my father try every form of diet, from Scarsdale through Atkins, from the Cambridge Diet to the Drinking Man&#x2019;s Diet. He&#x2019;d lost weight on each one of them, and then within a few months put it all back on, and more.<br> <br>Then, at the beginning of 2012, I was approached by Aidan Laverty, editor of the BBC science series Horizon, who asked if I would like to put myself forward as a guinea pig to explore the science behind life extension. I wasn&#x2019;t sure what we would find, but along with producer Kate Dart and researcher Roshan Samarasinghe, we quickly focused on calorie restriction and fasting as a fruitful area to explore.<br> <br>Calorie restriction (CR) is pretty brutal; it involves eating an awful lot less than a normal person would expect to eat, and doing so every day of your (hopefully) long life. The reason people put themselves through this is because it is the only intervention that has been shown to extend lifespan, at least in animals. There are around 50,000 CRONies (Calorie Restriction with Optimum Nutrition) worldwide, and I have met quite a number of them. Despite their generally fabulous biochemical profile, I have never been seriously tempted to join their skinny ranks. I simply don&#x2019;t have the willpower or desire to live permanently on an extreme low-calorie diet.<br> <br>So I was delighted to discover intermittent fasting (IF), which involves eating fewer calories, but only some of the time. If the science was right, it offered the benefits of CR but without the pain.<br> <br>I set off around the United States, meeting leading scientists who generously shared their research and ideas with me. It became clear that IF was no fad. But it wouldn&#x2019;t be as easy as I&#x2019;d originally hoped. As you&#x2019;ll see later in the book, there are many different forms of intermittent fasting. Some involve eating nothing for twenty-four hours or longer. Others involve eating a single, low-calorie meal once a day, every other day. I tried both but couldn&#x2019;t imagine doing either on a regular basis. I found it was simply too hard.<br> <br>Instead I decided to create and test my own modified version. Five days a week, I would eat normally; on the remaining two I would eat a quarter of my usual calorie intake (that is, 600 calories).<br> <br>I split the 600 calories in two&#x2014;around 250 calories for breakfast and 350 calories for supper&#x2014;effectively fasting for around twelve hours at a stretch. I also decided to split my fasting days: I would fast on Mondays and Thursdays. I became my own experiment.<br> <br>The program, Eat, Fast, Live Longer, which detailed my adventures with what we were now calling the 5:2 diet, appeared on the BBC during the London Olympics in August 2012. I expected it to be lost in the media frenzy that surrounded the Games, but instead it generated a frenzy of its own. The program was watched by more than 2.5 million people&#x2014;a huge audience for Horizon&#x2014;and hundreds of thousands more on YouTube. My Twitter account, @DrMichaelMosley, went into overdrive, my followers tripled; everyone wanted to try my version of intermittent fasting, and they were all asking me what they should do.<br> <br>The newspapers took up the story. Articles appeared in The Times (London), the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail, and the Mail on Sunday. Before long, it was picked up by newspapers all over the world&#x2014;in New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Madrid, Montreal, Islamabad, and New Delhi. Online groups were created, menus and experiences swapped, chat rooms started buzzing about fasting. People began to stop me on the street and tell me how well they were doing on the 5:2 diet. They also e-mailed details of their experiences. Among those e-mails, a surprisingly large number were from doctors. Like me, they had initially been skeptical, but they had tried it for themselves, found that it worked, and had begun suggesting it to their patients. They wanted information, menus, details of the scientific research to scrutinize. They wanted me to write a book. I hedged, procrastinated, then finally found a collaborator, Mimi Spencer, whom I liked and trusted and who has an in-depth knowledge of food. Which is how what you are reading came about.<br> Mimi&#x2019;s Motivation: A Female Perspective<p></p> <br>I started intermittent fasting on the day I was commissioned to write a feature for The Times about Michael&#x2019;s Horizon program. It was the first I&#x2019;d heard of intermittent fasting, and the idea appealed immediately, even to a cynical soul who has spent two decades examining the curious acrobatics of the fashion industry, the beauty business, and the diet trade.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d dabbled in diets before&#x2014;show me a fortysomething woman who hasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;losing weight, then losing faith within weeks and piling it all back on. Though never overweight, I&#x2019;d long been interested in dropping that reluctant seven to ten pounds&#x2014;the pounds I picked up in pregnancy and somehow never lost. The diets I tried were always too hard to follow, too complicated to implement, too boring, too tough, too single-strand, too invasive, sucking the juice out of life and leaving you with the scraps. There was nothing I found that I could adopt and thread into the context of my life&#x2014;as a mother, a working woman, a wife.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve argued for years that dieting is a fool&#x2019;s game, doomed to fail because of the restrictions and deprivations imposed on an otherwise happy life, but this felt immediately different. The scientific evidence was extensive and compelling, and (crucially for me) the medical community was positive. The effects, for Michael and others, were impressive, startling even. In his Horizon documentary, Michael called it the &#x201c;beginning of something huge . . . which could radically transform the nation&#x2019;s health.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t resist. Nor could I conceive of a reason to wait.<br> <br>The scientific evidence was extensive and compelling, and (crucially for me) the medical community was positive.<br> <br>In the two and a half years since I wrote the Times feature, I have remained a convert. An evangelist, actually. I&#x2019;m still &#x201c;on&#x201d; the FastDiet now, following a 6:1 pattern, but I barely notice it. At the outset, I weighed 132 pounds. At five feet, seven inches, my BMI was an okay 21.4. Today, as I write, I weigh 119 pounds, with a BMI of 19.4. That&#x2019;s a weight off. I feel light, lean, and alive. Fasting has become part of my weekly life, something I do automatically without stressing about it.<br> <br>I feel light, lean, and alive.<br> <br>These days, I have more energy, more bounce, clearer skin, a greater zest for life. And&#x2014;it has to be said&#x2014;new jeans (27-inch waist) and none of my annual bikini dread as summer approaches. But perhaps more important, I know that there&#x2019;s a long-term gain. I&#x2019;m doing the best for my body and my brain. It&#x2019;s an intimate revelation, but one worth sharing.<br> The FastDiet: The Potential, the Promise<p></p> <br>We know that for many people, the standard diet advice simply does not work. The FastDiet is a radical alternative. It has the potential to change the way we think about eating and weight loss.<br> <br>� The FastDiet demands that we think about not just what we eat, but when we eat it.<br> <br>� There are no complicated rules to follow; the strategy is flexible, comprehensible, and user-friendly.<br> <br>� There is no daily slog of calorie control&#x2014;none of the boredom, frustration, or serial deprivation that characterizes conventional diet plans.<br> <br>� Yes, it involves fasting, but not as you know it; you won&#x2019;t &#x201c;starve&#x201d; on any given day.<br> <br>� You can still enjoy the foods you love&#x2014;most of the time.<br> <br>� Once the weight is off, sticking to the basic program will mean that it stays off.<br> <br>� Weight loss is only one benefit of the FastDiet. The real dividend is the potential long-term health gains&#x2014;cutting your risk of a range of diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.<br> <br>� You will soon come to understand that it is not a diet. It is much more than that: it is a sustainable strategy for a healthy, long life.<br> <br>Now you&#x2019;ll want to understand exactly how we can make these dramatic assertions. In the next chapter, Michael explains the science that makes the FastDiet tick.</p><h2>The Potter&#39;s Studio Handbook: A start-to-finish guide to hand-built and wheel-thrown ceramics</h2><p><p>Pottery making and wheel throwing is a timeless craft, perfect for beginner crafters and artisans who don't mind getting their hands dirty.

When she experimented with meditation for the first time, however, her entire world changed. Woollacott&#x2019;s journey through years of meditation has made her question the reality she built her career upon and has forced her to ask what human consciousness really is. Infinite Awareness pairs Woollacott&#x2019;s research as a neuroscientist with her self-revelations about the mind&#x2019;s spiritual power. Between the scientific and spiritual worlds, she breaks open the definition of human consciousness to investigate the existence of a non-physical and infinitely powerful mind.</p><p>Marjorie Hines Woollacott, PhD, has been a neuroscience professor at the University of Oregon for more than three decades and a meditator for almost four. Her research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, and she coauthored a popular textbook for health professionals and has written more than 180 peer-reviewed research articles&#x2014;several of which were on meditation, the topic that motivated her to write Infinite Awareness.Those interested in the expanding vista of twenty-first century science will find her exploration engrossing and encouraging. (<i>Light of Consciousness: Journal of Spiritual Awakening</i>)<br><br>This is a courageous book that adds to the growing evidence that we must transform and expand our scientific view of consciousness to postulate its primacy and recover our own human dignity in the process. (<i>Network Review</i>)<br><br>Extensively referenced by chapter, plus a large bibliography and a good index, I really do recommend this book as it is a pleasure to read and she may well be correct in her interpretation of our existence. (<i>Journal of the Society for Psychical Research</i>)<br><br>One of the most deeply ingrained myths in modern western science is that the brain creates consciousness out of purely physical matter. This lies at the heart of conventional science, yet no neuroscientist on earth has even the vaguest notion of how that linkage might work. Neuroscientist Marjorie Woollacott recounts her own fascinating lifelong journey in pursuit of deeper understanding of the relationship between mind and brain, with the sharp, probing intellect and open mind of true scientific inquiry. Her beautifully rendered and personal story of discovery mirrors what is happening globally as science finally begins to address the deepest mystery known to all of human thought&#x2014;the nature of consciousness itself. This emergent revolution in scientific thinking and acceptance of the primacy of consciousness will fundamentally change how we view our own individual lives, humanity, and the universe. The implications are world-changing!

(Edward F. Kelly, professor of research, Division of Perceptual Studies, University of Virginia, and co-editor of Beyond Physicalism: Toward Reconciliation of Science and Spirituality)<br><br>Marjorie Woollacott has written an intellectual adventure story of the highest order. Drawing on her own experience as a highly regarded neuroscientist and a long-term meditator, she skillfully and engagingly invites readers to reassess the common scholarly prejudice against parapsychology. In doing so, she brings us to the threshold of a genuine paradigm shift in thinking about the mind and the brain. (Thomas B. Coburn, visiting scholar, Brown University; president emeritus, Naropa University)<br><br>Marjorie Woollacott takes us on a voyage of discovery as she integrates her neuroscientific expertise and meditative insight. A candid, lively exploration in which scientific curiosity and spiritual seeking nourish each other, and in which mind is revealed to be much more than brain. (Paul Marshall, PhD, BSc, RGN, RMN)<br><br>Marjorie Woollacott has written a gripping account of her evolution after an unexpected experience forced her to question her neurophysiological training and explore the scientific research on expanded consciousness. What she learned challenged her basic assumptions about who we are, and it may permanently change yours as well.

The main event that occurred in the days of Noah is recorded in Genesis 6:4: The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also after that...they were the heroes of old, men of renown. Nephilim in Hebrew means the fallen ones . These were evil fallen angels who appeared on the earth in those days and caused the violence, bloodshed and chaos which resulted in a world-wide Flood. As it was...so shall it be. After the Apocalypse begins, these same fallen angels, plus Satan and all the rest of those that rebelled with him, will once again manifest on earth in plain sight. They will be led by a man most call The Antichrist. But in Revelation he is not given this name. John refers to him as The Beast from the Abyss. This book is an in-depth study of the Beast s past, present and future which debunks most of the common and accepted assumptions of the Antichrist and instead presents a scripturally based study of he who is to come; The Beast who ascends out of the Abyss having seven heads and ten horns.</p><p>Patrick Heron was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1952. At age 24 he had a Saul on the road to Damascus type epiphany while reading the Bible. Thus began his Christian walk. Around the mid 90 s he got interested in End Times studies. He wanted to make this information available to the ordinary man in the street, and published his first book, Apocalypse Soon, in 1997 which became a bestseller in Ireland. He followed up two years later with The Apocalypse Generation. Then in 2004, he published his most successful book, The Nephilim and the Pyramid of the Apocalypse. It immediately shot to number one bestseller in the prophecy section of Amazon Books where it remained for almost two years. The Nephilim is widely accepted as being a seminal work on the topic of the fallen angels of Genesis 6 and continues to receive critical acclaim. It has been translated into Korean, Spanish, and Portuguese as in available in Spain, Brazil and Argentina. Because of the research in this book, Patrick Heron received an honorary Doctorate in Christian Literature from the California Pacific School of Theology. He also holds a B.Sc. and an MA in Business and a B.Sc. in Theology. Grizzly Adams Productions have made two documentary films featuring Patrick Heron and his work which have featured on dozens of TV stations across the USA. The best known of these is, Apocalypse and the End Times. Patrick Heron s latest book, Return of the Antichrist and the New World Order, is another seminal and pioneering work and the first in-depth study of the man who is named 33 times in the Book of Revelation as The Beast from the Abyss. This book will challenge widely held beliefs concerning the coming Antichrist and is set to be a controversial and revisionist volume which will explode and debunk many of the accepted facts concerning this individual. His conclusions are taken exclusively from scripture. Patrick Heron has featured on hundreds of radio and TV stations both in the USA and internationally. He has spoken at several international conferences and his DVD, The Return of the Nephilim, has been widely viewed.

Boy, was I wrong. I had fallen head-over-heels. Deadwood had gotten under my skin. Its golden history filled my mind with daydreams; its promising future spurred tales that needed to be told.<br><br>Nearly Departed in Deadwood is a contemporary mystery full of colorful characters that have been taking root inside of my noggin for almost three decades. The seed was planted when I was a young teenager sitting on the bench outside of the old Prospector Gift Shop on Main Street, waiting for my mom to get off work. Over the years, the seed sprouted as I hiked all over town, strolling around Wild Bill Hickok's and Seth Bullock's gravestones at Mount Moriah Cemetery, sitting on the steps outside the Deadwood Public Library, walking up and down Main Street, perusing the tourist shops. <br><br>As times changed, so did Deadwood. The drugstore where I used to buy candy, the clothing store where I bought my favorite Levi's, and the Prospector Gift Shop are all gone now. At first I was sad to see them go, but then I realized that Deadwood had to transform and grow in order to survive. Just like I did.<br><br>A couple of years ago, I was driving down Strawberry Hill on my way into Deadwood when an idea hit me. It was a "what if" moment that sparked the fire of a story in my head. This time, the "what if" involved a single mom, living in Deadwood, struggling to make ends meet with two kids--twins--for whom she had to provide. I had one young child and another on the way at the time, so taking care of kids was front and center in my mind (and my body). <br><br>As I drove through Deadwood that day, memories ran rampant in my mind, and the story you hold in your hands began to take shape. I could see it clearly. I'd name the heroine Violet, an old-fashioned name. I could hear her voice; see her in her favorite purple cowboy boots. I knew exactly the location of the realty office where Violet would work, the street she'd live on, and how I'd pull Deadwood's past into the story and intermingle it with the present. <br><br>Over the following month, I plotted this story. My poor husband was forced to listen to my ideas morning, noon, and night; there was no shutting me up. Then he caught the Deadwood bug, too, and he joined me in brainstorming and planning. Before I even wrote the first line, I knew that one book was not going to be enough to tell this story, but I had to start somewhere. Finally, after months of writing, I reached "The End" of Nearly Departed in Deadwood, the first book in a series, with much hooting and hollering in celebration. <br><br>Now, after several rounds of editing and a lot of polishing, I want to share Violet's story with you. If you have half as much fun reading it as I had writing it, you'll close the book when you're finished with a big grin on your face--especially since you know there is more fun to come.<br><br>Thank you for joining me in this adventure.

Jack Prelutsky lives in Washington State. </p>Grade 2-5 A dinosaur book collaboration between Arnold Lobel and Jack Prelutsky sounds almost too good to be true. And that's the case with this book, which has good intentions but doesn't quite carry through with them. No problem with Lobel's illustrations, which combine just the right amount of fantasy and realism to capture a child's imagination. It's Prelutsky's verse which is the detractor here. True, some of the poems are rollicking and fun, such as these lines describing Deinonychus: ``Ferocity was its predominant trait,/ its habits were purely predacious,/ it ate what it caught, and it caught what it ate/ in the days of the early Cretaceous.'' But for many of these poems, much of the verse seems confined by the subject matter, as if Prelutsky were afraid to let his imagination enhance what he considers factual information. Sadly, some of the information he reiterates about dinosaurs is out of date; the idea of small-brained, prehistoric plodders doomed for extinction is no more. Prelutsky would do well to get hold of a copy of Bakker's Dinosaur Heresies (Morrow, 1986) and update his perception of herbivores and Sauropods, in particular. Thoughtful pronunciation guides help readers tackle colossal dinosaur names, but young readers will still struggle with the many other multisyllabic words that set the cadence of these rhymes.

But in this passionate corrective to the idea that DNA is destiny, Jesse Prinz focuses on the most extraordinary aspect of human nature: that nurture can supplement and supplant nature, allowing our minds to be profoundly influenced by experience and culture. Drawing on cutting-edge research in neuroscience, psychology, and anthropology, Prinz shatters the myth of human uniformity and reveals how our differing cultures and life experiences make each of us unique. Along the way he shows that we can&#x2019;t blame mental illness or addiction on our genes, and that societal factors shape gender differences in cognitive ability and sexual behavior.

No other food says &#x201c;America&#x201d; like the hamburger, and documentary filmmaker George Motz has made it his personal mission to save our nation's unique burger identity. He has traveled across the country in search of the best burger joints - those that have survived outside the fast-food mainstream - and has documented their rich histories and one-of-a-kind taste experiences. This edition of the book includes George Motz's 1 hour documentary &#x201c;Hamburger America&#x201d; that profiles 8 burger joints across the USA.</p><p><p><b>George Motz</b>&nbsp;is a documentary filmmaker and America's foremost hamburger expert.&nbsp;He has taught a course on hamburgers at NYU and has consulted for many hamburger restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hamburger America</i>&nbsp;(the film) became required viewing in a food course at Princeton University and was nominated for a James Beard award. George has been featured on the&nbsp;<i>Martha Stewart Show</i>&nbsp;and other national outlets including&nbsp;<i>USA Today</i>,&nbsp;<i>Saveur</i>, and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>for his hamburger expertise. He lives in Brooklyn, NY with his wife and two children.</p>In the 2005 documentary of the same name (included with the book), Motz documented eight classic hamburger joints across the country. In the ensuing years he's broadened his horizons but not his tastes; here he presents a hundred hamburger spots in 39 states, each profiled with love and accompanied by mouthwatering full-color portraits. From Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Conn.-allegedly the oldest continuously operating hamburger establishment in the U.S.-to Olympia, Wash.'s Eastside Big Tom, Motz talks with the owners, employees and customers who keep the cuisine alive and eclectic. In addition to the traditional, Motz introduces readers to regional spins like Iowa's Maid Rite sandwich, a kind of sauceless Sloppy Joe; the green chili-topped burgers of Santa Fe's Bobcat Bite; and Sedalia, Missouri's "Guberburger," dressed with melted peanut butter. Motz limits his selections to independently owned operations that use fresh, not frozen, meat, the most shining example of which is Oklahoma's Joe Maranto, who raises longhorn cattle for eating at his nearby restaurant. Those with a soft spot for Americana, diner cuisine or delicious burgers will delight in this bright, quirky love letter to the American everyman staple, complete with contact information and recipes. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He published his first novel Casino Royale in 1953 and thus started the astoundingly successful James Bond novels and films. Fleming died in 1964.<p><b>1. SEASCAPE WITH FIGURES</b></p> <p>The five-mile promenade of Royale-les-Eaux, backed by trim lawns emblazoned at intervals with tricolour beds of salvia, alyssum and lobelia, was bright with flags and, on the longest beach in the north of France, the gay bathing tents still marched prettily down to the tide-line in big, money-making battalions. Music, one of those lilting accordion waltzes, blared from the loud-speakers around the Olympic-size piscine and, from time to time, echoing above the music, a man's voice announced over the public address system that Phil-ippe Bertrand, aged seven, was looking for his mother, that Yolande Lefevre was waiting for her friends below the clock at the entrance, or that a Madame Dufours was demanded on the telephone. From the beach, particularly from the neighbourhood of the three play-ground enclosures - 'Joie de Vivre', 'Helio' and 'Azur' - came a twitter of children's cries that waxed and waned with the thrill of their games and, farther out, on the firm sand left by the now distant sea, the shrill whistle of the physical-fitness instructor marshalled his teenagers through the last course of the day.</p> <p>It was one of those beautiful, naive seaside panoramas for which the Brittany and Picardy beaches have provided the setting - and inspired their recorders, Boudin, Tissot, Monet - ever since the birth of plages and bains de mer more than a hundred years ago.</p> <p>To James Bond, sitting in one of the concrete shelters with his face to the setting sun, there was something poignant, ephemeral about it all. It reminded him almost too vividly of childhood - of the velvet feel of the hot powder sand, and the painful grit of wet sand between young toes when the time came for him to put his shoes and socks on, of the precious little pile of sea-shells and interesting wrack on the sill of his bedroom window ('No, we'll have to leave that behind, darling. It'll dirty up your trunk!'), of the small crabs scuttling away from the nervous fingers groping beneath the seaweed in the rock-pools, of the swimming and swimming and swimming through the dancing waves -always in those days it seemed, lit with sunshine - and then the infuriating, inevitable 'time to come out'. It was all there, his own childhood, spread out before him to have another look at. What a long time ago they were, those spade-and-bucket days! How far he had come since the freckles and the Cadbury milk chocolate Flakes and the fizzy lemonade! Impatiently Bond lit a cigarette, pulled his shoulders out of their slouch and slammed the mawkish memories back into their long-closed file. Today he was a grown-up, a man with years of dirty, dangerous memories - a spy. He was not sitting in this concrete hideout to sentimentalise about a pack of scrubby, smelly children on a beach scattered with bottle-tops and lolly-sticks and fringed by a sea thick with sun-oil and putrid with the main drains of Royale. He was here, he had chosen to be here, to spy. To spy on a woman.</p> <p>The sun was getting lower. Already one could smell the September chill that all day had lain hidden beneath the heat. The cohorts of bathers were in quick retreat, striking their little camps and filtering up the steps and across the promenade into the shelter of the town where the lights were going up in the cafes. The announcer at the swimming-pool harried his customers: 'Allo! Allo! Fermeture en dix minutes! A dix-huit heures, fermeture de la piscine!' Silhouetted in the path of the setting sun, the two Bombard rescue-boats with flags bearing a blue cross on a yellow background were speeding northwards for their distant shelter up-river in the Vieux Port. The last of the gay, giraffe-like sand-yachts fled down the distant water-line towards its corral among the sand dunes, and the three agents cyclistes in charge of the car-parks pedalled away through the melting ranks of cars towards the police station in the centre of the town. In a matter of minutes the vast expanse of sand - the tide, still receding, was already a mile out - would be left to the seagulls that would soon be flocking in their hordes to forage for the scraps of food left by the picnickers. Then the orange ball of the sun would hiss down into the sea and the beach would, for a while, be entirely deserted, until, under cover of darkness, the prowling lovers would come to writhe briefly, grittily in the dark corners between the bathing-huts and the sea-wall.</p> <p>On the beaten stretch of sand below where James Bond was sitting, two golden girls in exciting bikinis packed up the game of Jokari which they had been so provocatively playing, and raced each other up the steps towards Bond's shelter. They flaunted their bodies at him, paused and chattered to see if he would respond, and, when he didn't, linked arms and sauntered on towards the town, leaving Bond wondering why it was that French girls had more prominent navels than any others. Was it that French surgeons sought to add, even in this minute respect, to the future sex-appeal of girl babies?</p> <p>And now, up and down the beach, the lifeguards gave a final blast on their horns to announce that they were going off duty, the music from the piscine stopped in mid-tune and the great expanse of sand was suddenly deserted.</p> <p>But not quite! A hundred yards out, lying face down-wards on a black and white striped bathing-wrap, on the private patch of firm sand where she had installed herself an hour before, the girl was still there, motion-less, spread-eagled in direct line between James Bond and the setting sun that was now turning the left-behind pools and shallow rivulets into blood-red, meandering scrawls across the middle distance. Bond went on watching her - now, in the silence and emptiness, with an ounce more tension. He was waiting for her to do something - for something, he didn't know what, to happen. It would be more true to say that he was watching over her. He had an instinct that she was in some sort of danger. Or was it just that there was the smell of danger in the air? He didn't know. He only knew that he mustn't leave her alone, particularly now that everyone else had gone.</p> <p>James Bond was mistaken. Not everyone else had gone. Behind him, at the Cafe de la Plage on the other side of the promenade, two men in raincoats and dark caps sat at a secluded table bordering the sidewalk. They had half-empty cups of coffee in front of them and they didn't talk. They sat and watched the blur on the frosted-glass partition of the shelter that was James Bond's head and shoulders. They also watched, but less intently, the distant white blur on the sand that was the girl. Their stillness, and their unseasonable clothes, would have made a disquieting impression on anyone who, in his turn, might have been watching them. But there was no such person, except their waiter who had simply put them in the category of 'bad news' and hoped they would soon be on their way.</p> <p>When the lower rim of the orange sun touched the sea, it was almost as if a signal had sounded for the girl. She slowly got to her feet, ran both hands backwards through her hair and began to walk evenly, purposefully towards the sun and the far-away froth of the water-line over a mile away. It would be violet dusk by the time she reached the sea and one might have guessed that this was probably the last day of her holiday, her last bathe.</p> <p>James Bond thought otherwise. He left his shelter, ran down the steps to the sand and began walking out after her at a fast pace. Behind him, across the promenade, the two men in raincoats also seemed to think otherwise. One of them briskly threw down some coins and they both got up and, walking strictly in step, crossed the promenade to the sand and, with a kind of urgent military precision, marched rapidly side by side in Bond's tracks.</p> <p>Now the strange pattern of figures on the vast expanse of empty, blood-streaked sand was eerily conspicuous. Yet it was surely not one to be interfered with! The pattern had a nasty, a secret smell. The white girl, the bare-headed young man, the two squat, marching pursuers - it had something of a kind of deadly Grand-mother's Steps about it. In the cafe, the waiter collected the coins and looked after the distant figures, still outlined by the last quarter of the orange sun. It smelt like police business - or the other thing. He would keep it to himself but remember it. He might get his name in the papers.</p> <p>James Bond was rapidly catching up with the girl. Now he knew that he would get to her just as she reached the waterline. He began to wonder what he would say to her, how he would put it. He couldn't say, 'I had a hunch you were going to commit suicide so I came after you to stop you.' 'I was going for a walk on the beach and I thought I recognised you. Will you have a drink after your swim?' would be childish. He l finally decided to say,' Oh, Tracy!' and then, when she turned round, 'I was worried about you.' Which would at least be inoffensive and, for the matter of that, true.</p> <p>The sea was now gunmetal below a primrose horizon. A small, westerly offshore breeze, drawing the hot land-air out to sea, had risen and was piling up wavelets that scrolled in whitely as far as the eye could see. Flocks of herring gulls lazily rose and settled again at the girl's approach, and the air was full of their mewing and of the endless lap-lap of the small waves. The soft indigo dusk added a touch of melancholy to the empty solitude of sand and sea, now so far away from the comforting bright lights and holiday bustle of 'La Reine de la Cote Opale', as Royale-les-Eaux had splendidly christened herself. Bond looked forward to getting the girl back to those bright lights. He watched the lithe golden figure in the white one-piece bathing-suit and wondered how soon she would be able to hear his voice above the noise of the gulls and the sea. Her pace had slowed a fraction as she approached the water-line and her head, with its bell of heavy fair hair to the shoulders, was slightly bowed, in thought perhaps, or tiredness.</p> <p>Bond quickened his step until he was on...</p></p><h2>A Very Cowboy Christmas: Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, Y&#39;all (Smokin&#39; Hot Cowboys, 3)</h2><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month!</strong></p><p><strong>There's nothing like a firefighting cowboy to keep you toasty warm this Christmas...</strong></p><p>Christmas is coming up, and single mom Sydney Steele is determined to make this a holiday to remember for Wildcat Bluff County.

But freedom didn't come for slaves at the same time. DAYS OF JUBILEE chronicles the various stages of U.S. emancipation beginning with those slaves who were freed for their service during the Revolutionary War, to those who were freed by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. Using slave narratives, letters, diaries, military orders, and other documents, the McKissacks invite young readers to celebrate coming freedom and the Days of Jubilee.</p><p>Gr. 5-8. As this book clearly shows, there was no single day when slavery ended in the U.S. but a series of dates when groups and individual slaves celebrated their own "days of Jubilee." The discussion begins after the Revolutionary War, when many of the African Americans who had fought were freed, but it quickly moves on to the Civil War era. Each chapter begins with a quotation from a historical document, followed by a boxed story that tells, for example, of a slave family escaping to the Union army or a Boston church congregation receiving word that Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation. The quotations are sourced (though often identified only as "slave Narrative"), but no source notes are given for the boxed narratives, which occasionally seem lightly fictionalized. The McKissacks do a remarkable job of explaining Civil War history as it relates to the end of slavery, and their lively account presents the war and its consequences in very human terms. For instance, it relates that in New York when, for the first time in history, photographs of the dead and dying soldiers on a battlefield went on display, "people cried out in horror." The balanced perspective, vivid telling, and well-chosen details give this book an immediacy that many history books lack. Illustrations include reproductions of many period photographs as well as paintings, prints, and documents, and a time line and a bibliography are appended. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>Grade 4-8-In this readable, well-organized book, the McKissacks make extensive use of firsthand slave narratives collected in the 1930s. As well as documenting the gradual end of slavery, they discuss many other historic events and controversies, using the viewpoints recorded in Southerner Mary Chestnut's Civil War diary and other primary sources. Brief descriptions of the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, the unequal treatment of African Americans by whites in both the North and the South after slavery ended, and the progress made by the civil rights movement are included. A sidebar erroneously states that "-a slave ship-docked in Mobile Harbor at night on July 9, 1866.-Fowler couldn't sell the slaves, so when the Civil War began, he set the captives free." The book is illustrated with many historical duotone photographs and engravings, but there is no map showing the battles described in the text. Readers familiar with Civil War history will be fascinated by the wealth of information on African Americans' contributions to the war effort, but those researching only the end of slavery may feel overwhelmed by tangential accounts of battles and military leaders.

"Ixtlan" turns out to be a metaphorical hometown ( or Place / Position of Being ) to which the "sorcerer" or warrior or man of knowledge without reason or thoughts is drawn to return.</p><p>Born in 1925 in Peru, anthropologist <b>Carlos Castaneda</b> wrote a total of 15 books, which sold 8 million copies worldwide and were published in 17 different languages.

Missouri Homestead introduces the heroine and her husband after they lose their farm in South Dakota and face a new life in Mansfield, Missouri, where Laura takes a job as a journalist. Children of Promise portrays her as a journalist fighting for the rights of farm children to be educated. Good Neighbors presents the Wilders as the town's good samaritans during a devastating winter blizzard. Plot and themes are integrated into a formulaic narrative that has a subtle underlying message about believing in God. Wilder is shown as modern and liberated for her time, yet is occasionally characterized as the stereotypical early 20th-century dutiful American wife and mother. This completely fictionalized series pales in comparison to the "Little House" books (HarperCollins); a disclaimer ("Names, characters, and incidents . . . their resemblance, if any, to real-life counterparts is purely coincidental) seems disingenuous, given the repeated use of this pioneer woman's name and family.

Consisting of The Great Fortune (1960), The Spoilt City (1962), and Friends and Heroes (1965), the trilogy is a semiautobiographical account of a British couple living in the Balkans during World War II. The complex narrative, composed of several different voices, is noted for its vivid historicity. In The Great Fortune, newlyweds Guy and Harriet Pringle encounter an increasingly fascist environment in Bucharest, Romania, in 1939. Guy is a gregarious university lecturer whose liberal views contrast with those of his reserved wife. Clarence Lawson is a colleague of Guy who worships him and finds Harriet attractive. In The Spoilt City, Harriet faces marital problems and befriends Sasha Drucker, a Romanian army deserter, and Prince Yakimov, a Russian emigre. Just before the arrival of German troops in Bucharest, Guy sends Harriet to Greece, where they are reunited in Friends and Heroes. Guy acquires a teaching post and becomes involved in communist politics. By the end of the novel, the Pringles repair their marriage and flee to Cairo, where their story is continued in The Levant Trilogy. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>The NEW Knitter&#39;s Template: Your Guide to Custom Fit and Style</h2><p><p>Back by popular demand, this is the must-have guidebook for anyone who wants to stitch knits that fit and flatter!

Includes illustrations showing the pressure points used in self-defense techniques.</p><p>George A. Dillman, a 9th degree black belt in Ryukyu Kempo Tomari-te, recently honored by Black Belt Magazine as &#x201c; 1997--Instructor of the Year&#x201d; is one of the U.S.A.&#x2019;s best known and well-established martial arts personalities. Dillman came to the attention of the martial arts press when he began competing in the early 1960&#x2019;s. By the end of that decade, he had started running his own tournament, called the Northeast Open Karate Championships. This competition was held annually-- the first kicking off in Palmer Park, Maryland in 1966. The site was moved to Suitland Maryland in 1967, and moved again to Reading, PA in 1968 where it was held until 1996. <p>Official Karate magazine (Nov.1982), described Dillman as, &#x201c;one of the winningest competitors karate has ever known.&#x201d; Dillman was four-times National Karate Champion (1969-1972) and during this period was consistently ranked among top ten competitors in the nation by major karate magazines. During his nine-year competitive career, Dillman claimed a total of 327 trophies in fighting, forms, breaking, and weapons. </p><p>Dillman began serious martial arts training in 1961 with Harry G. Smith. He went on to study with Daniel K. Pai, James Coffman, Sam Pearson, Robert Trias and Seiyu Oyata. Dillman has always considered himself a student, never a master of the martial arts. To this end he and his wife and students have traveled throughout the United States to meet and train with various martial arts experts. </p><p>Because of his perseverance, Dillman&#x2019;s martial arts talents have earned him widespread U.S. media coverage. He has appeared on 35 National TV shows, including: Real People, Mike Douglas, PM Magazine, Evening Magazine, and NBC&#x2019;s Sports Machine. Dillman has also been featured five times in Ripley&#x2019;s Believe It or Not, and has been the subject of over 300 newspaper and magazine articles. Dillman, who was a professional boxer for three and one half years, is the only person known to have trained with both Bruce Lee and Muhammad Ali. In May of 1988. Dillman was inducted into the Berks County Sports Hall of Fame. He was the first martial artist to be included. </p><p>Currently, Dillman travels the world teaching seminars on pressure points and tuite (grappling) hidden within the traditional movements of the old martial arts forms. It is his research and scientific dissection of the old forms that is earning him his most notoriety. Never one to shy away from controversy, Dillman has rediscovered a formerly secret level of meaning for kata movements, and has made that interpretation understandable to all. He has produced a video tape instructional series on the pressure points, and has written six books with Chris Thomas: Kyusho-Jitsu: The Dillman Method of Pressure Point Fighting; Advanced Pressure Point Fighting of Ryukyu Kempo; Advanced Pressure Point Grappling: Tuite; Pressure Point Karate Made Easy; Humane Pressure Point Self-Defense; and Little Jay Learns Karate. The books have been said to be,&#x201d; the definitive martial arts books of the century,&#x201d; and &#x201c;unparalleled among current martial arts literature.&#x201d; </p><p>Dillman is the chief instructor for Dillman Karate International, an organization of over 85 schools worldwide, with an enrollment of nearly 15,000 students. He has studied under five 10th degree black belts from Okinawa and is currently furthering his personal study through research, practice, and the sharing of techniques with Prof. Remy Presas ( Modern Arnis) and Prof. Wally Jay (Small Circle Jujitsu). Chris Thomas has studied karate since 1970, and holds a black belt ranking in three separate styles: Shotokan, Isshinryu, and Ryukyu Kempo Tomari-te. Thomas is a widely published and respected authority on martial arts whose works have appeared in martial arts periodicals world-wide.</p></p><h2>Girlfriends: Invisible Bonds, Enduring Ties</h2><p>Ask any woman and she&#39;ll tell you that her friendships with other women are among the most important relationships in her life.

He became associate editor of Outlook in 1928 and subsequently was a staff writer for several magazines, including The New Yorker.

Then she met Ajay, a charming and unassuming Indian journalist, and her world turned upside down. Traveling from her shiny, rapid-fire life in Hong Kong to Ajay's native village, Alison learns that not all is as it seems. Turns out that Ajay is a landed prince (of sorts), but his family palace is falling to pieces. Replete with plumbing issues, strange noises, and intimidating relatives, her new love's ramshackle palace, Mokimpur, is a broken-down relic in desperate need of a makeover. And Alison wonders if she can soldier on for the sake of the man who just might be her soul mate.</p><p> This modern-day fairytale, WHERE THE PEACOCKS SING, takes readers on a cross-cultural journey from the manicured gardens of Beverly Hills, to the bustling streets of Hong Kong and finally to the rural Indian countryside as Alison comes to terms with her complicated new family, leaves the modern world behind, and learns the true meaning of home.</p></p><p><p>ALISON SINGH GEE is an award-winning international journalist whose work has been translated into eight languages and has appeared in <i>People, Vanity Fair, In Style, Marie Claire, International Herald Tribune, The Wall Street Journal </i>and<i> Los Angeles Times</i>.

Alison lives in Los Angeles with her husband and daughter.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Fear of Flying <br> <br> <i>I never knew peacocks could</i> fly. <br>I never knew they could do much of anything. As a child growing up in Northeast Los Angeles, I only ever saw them at the botanical gardens in Pasadena or roaming the zoo. They were stunning birds, with their built-in tiaras and show-off coloring. But let&#x2019;s face it: They seemed pretty useless. Waddling across manicured lawns, admiring flowers, plopping their fat stomachs onto grassy patches in the shade, these pampered birds only broke a sweat when the garden groundskeeper rang the dinner bell. Peacocks were charming but relatively pointless, flashing their plumage like a socialite working her best fur and jewels, and that&#x2019;s all. <br>Or so I thought. <br>My understanding of peacocks was about to take a quantum leap. <br>I was sitting on the terrace of a palace in India. This was not some trussed-up five-star hotel in a commercialized Indian city, lousy with Patagonia-clad tourists. This was the ancestral home that had belonged to my fianc� Ajay&#x2019;s family for the past century, and it was the kind of regal spread you&#x2019;d find in a Merchant Ivory film&#x2014;huge, awe-inspiring, and vibrating with legacy. The house stood like a porcelain deity in the middle of a lush and flowering village called Mokimpur, which is also the name the Singh family gave the house. Ajay had spent much of his childhood at this magnificent residence, playing hide-and-seek in its hundred rooms, racing his village friends along the river, and jumping into the deep, cool reservoir when the summer heat became unbearable. <br>With its fragrant mango groves, silent skies, and choruses of songbirds and screeching parrots, Mokimpur was about as different from my hometown as the moon. Later, when I looked at a globe and placed my finger on Northern India, I realized that Ajay&#x2019;s tiny village sat almost literally on the opposite side of the sphere from where I grew up. But it&#x2019;s not like I needed a map to tell me what I already knew in my heart. <br>As an American journalist based in Hong Kong, my life was anything but placid, predictable, or comforting. My cell phone buzzed every two minutes; I had a half-dozen deadlines to meet every day, and a whirling social world that included lots of good friends (most of whose last names I somehow never quite learned). Hong Kong, the futuristic gateway to the East, had skyscrapers instead of trees, subway platforms instead of terraces, daredevil taxis instead of slow-moving yaks. Lunch was often a bowl of noodles eaten standing up; dinner, cocktail party hors d&#x2019;oeuvres and a lethal gin and tonic. (Breakfast wasn&#x2019;t actually in my vocabulary&#x2014;I usually jumped out of bed at the blast of the alarm clock, wriggled into a dress, strapped on some heels, and dashed out the door.) In this insanely built-up, inhumanly crowded place, where apartment towers seemingly sprang up overnight like bamboo, the locals liked to say that the national bird was the jackhammer. <br>Not so in Mokimpur. <br>It was my first week in India. Ajay and I were idling over steaming cups of chai and plates heaped with mouthwatering veg <i>pakora,</i> deep-fried cauliflower, onions, potatoes, and carrots with a spiced, crispy coating. Three servants dressed in kurtas and loose cotton pants ferried about filling teacups and delivering fresh chutney and hot <i>samosas</i>. As Ajay and I lounged on the veranda, I watched dozens of wild peacocks, shrieking with glee as they glided from mango tree to neem tree, streaking the sky with their over-the-top rainbow colors. <br>Peacocks, not jackhammers, are the national bird of India. Here they were almost unrecognizable to me, not at all like their L.A. cousins. Indian peacocks were tenacious and fierce, agile and vocal. Roaming wild in the villages, these birds were just like the people&#x2014;warriors in the primordial battle for survival. I watched them in the middle distance and shook my head. &#x201c;All this time I thought they were ground dwellers,&#x201d; I said to Ajay. &#x201c;Who knew these humongous things could jet through the trees like that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This is India,&#x201d; Ajay said. &#x201c;We do whatever we need to do to survive&#x2014;if that means flying, we fly.&#x201d; He took a sip of his chai and tilted his head. &#x201c;An Indian peacock can kill a baby cobra in thirty seconds flat. Their beaks are laser sharp. Before the snake knows what&#x2019;s happened, it&#x2019;s been sliced into a pile of sashimi.&#x201d; He looked dashing in his white kurta pajama suit, and worlds apart from any man I&#x2019;d ever dated. <br>Suddenly, we heard a great flapping of wings and a thud so loud it caused us to turn in our chairs. Two peahens and a peacock had landed on the veranda ledge, a few feet from where we sat. They jumped down and, like plump gymnasts, bounded over and pranced around us. Their giant bodies wobbled on sinewy legs that looked like they&#x2019;d done their share of kicking other pheasant ass. The birds turned their faces to the sky and let out a series of shrieks. I covered my ears and winced. <br>&#x201c;What in God&#x2019;s name are they doing?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re dancing in the sun to keep themselves warm,&#x201d; Ajay explained, wrapping a shatoosh around his neck. &#x201c;They move around all day in packs foraging for seeds in the fields, searching for rain.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But why are they crying like that?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not crying,&#x201d; Ajay said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re singing. They&#x2019;re excited because they think they hear thunder, and thunder means rain. You should hear them go at it when a jet flies overhead. They scream as if an apocalypse has come to the village.&#x201d; <br>I couldn&#x2019;t help but feel sorry for the poor birds, because the modern world had confused their primal instincts so much. It wasn&#x2019;t rain that was coming whenever they heard a boom in the sky; it was just another planeload of tourists, hoping to find cheap handicrafts and an unspoiled stretch of beach on the Subcontinent. I also felt a little disheartened at my own warped intuition: What sounded to me like cries of sadness were actually shrieks of glee. Maybe modern life in the big city had confused me, too. In Hong Kong, some nights I lay awake wondering if there was any escape in the world from flashing neon signs and construction rubble. <br>Just as quickly as they had landed, the peacocks took off into the sky, rising swiftly above the trees, over the palace wall and into the farmland beyond. I sprang up to watch them as they flapped out of sight. Indian peacocks did not just fly. They soared. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> <i>All my life, I had</i> been a bona fide city girl, a creature of the first world at its commercial finest. After college in California, I had gone to graduate school in London, and now I lived in Hong Kong, the Orient&#x2019;s Manhattan, only four times as fast. I worked as a journalist for Time Inc., jetting throughout Asia on assignment. My days began with <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> and a latte from the Pacific Coffee Company in Wanchai, and often ended at a crowded cocktail party in the city or at a catered dinner fete on a Chinese junk, cruising Victoria Harbour. <br>India was never part of my life plan. After all, it sat on the other side of the world, some nine thousand miles from Los Angeles&#x2014;the chaotic, dusty, and painfully poor side, I was sure. But since I&#x2019;d met Ajay, everything in my life had changed. He not only loved his native land, he belonged to it. He had an almost primal attachment to his home village and the family palace that rose from the wheat fields. <br>&#x201c;No matter where I go, where I live, or what I become, when I come back to Mokimpur, it&#x2019;s home like no other place,&#x201d; he explained to me. &#x201c;I get an inexplicable feeling of peace here. If I ever reached a breaking point in our life in Hong Kong or America I know I could return to Mokimpur and recover. I wouldn&#x2019;t need to do anything or talk to anyone. I would just need to stay here and reestablish my connection with the land.&#x201d; <br>I had never felt that way about any place before. Home for me was always a backdrop for chaos and pain. A place to run from, not to. Part of me admired, or maybe I should say envied, Ajay&#x2019;s unshakable attachment to his village. Another part of me lusted after the palace&#x2019;s hundred rooms and the fabulous makeover I knew I could give it. And the deepest part of me wondered if this could be my home, too. <br>In the days to come, I would learn that life here was about hours of silence, sipping chai and contemplating the clouds. The main events of the day were family meals, three-hour lunches that broke up only when it was time for tea. We would take afternoon ambles along the village river and eat our dinners by kerosene lamp. While the servants tidied up the kitchen, we were free to sit around talking with the family for hours or read stacks of books by candlelight, stretched out in the big four-poster wooden bed that once belonged to Ajay&#x2019;s great-grandfather. <br>While all this might sound idyllic, I truly did not know if this was what I wanted, if this could ever be what I wanted. Life here was just so drastically different from the overscheduled, underexamined existence I had gotten accustomed to living. In Mokimpur, my motor shifted to idle. In my normal life my brain threatened to explode with ideas and details and the more-than-occasional anxiety attack; here it seemed to go on strike. Now on my fourth cup of chai, I took in the scene in the fields&#x2014;a row of villagers sheathed in saffron- and ruby-colored saris plucking mangoes from a shady grove. Then I turned and suddenly caught sight of my image in one of the haveli windows. Mokimpur&#x2019;s all-day dress code was homespun cotton kurta pajamas, but I had put on a Diane von Furstenberg wrap dress, suede platforms, and Kate Spade sunglasses. I laughed at my reflection. I looked like a wannabe starlet cast in the wrong destiny. My mind knew me as corporate girl, first-world chick, habitu� of Philippe Starck&#x2013;designed bars. <br>But my soul seemed to be opening itself up to some other identity. &#x201c;Holy cow,&#x201d; I whispered to myself. My heart raced. I took off my shades and ran my hands through my shoulder-length hair. <br>If I were Alice falling through the looking glass, Mokimpur is where I would land. A frisson of panic coursed through me. &#x201c;What exactly am I doing in this Indian village?&#x201d; I muttered to Ajay. <br>He laughed and reached for my hand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re here to learn to milk cows and collect eggs from underneath hens in the coop. To wake to the chatter of wild parrots, not CNN. To taste a mango plucked straight from the tree. To learn that real meals take hours to make, not thirty seconds in the microwave.&#x201d; He was on a roll and he knew it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re here to forget about your cell phone and your Mac laptop,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re here to learn the real rhythm of the earth. It&#x2019;s not staying out dancing until five in the morning, you know. That&#x2019;s actually when most of the villagers get up.&#x201d; Right on cue, a peacock landed on the terrace, shook his feathers, lifted his head, and shrieked, as if echoing Ajay&#x2019;s soliloquy. <br>I looked at Ajay quizzically, but he hadn&#x2019;t even registered the bird. His face was as calm and content as I&#x2019;d ever seen it. So I allowed myself to wonder what Mokimpur could mean to me. <br>My heart told me I had arrived here for a reason. Maybe I could bring new life to the palace. And I had the feeling that Mokimpur could offer me something essential and precious in exchange. An escape from the twenty-first century? A place to call home? Or maybe the palace could send earthbound me into flight. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Alison Singh Gee <br></p><h2>Jung and Christianity: The Challenge of Reconciliation</h2><p>Many men and women today are experiencing a crisis of meaninglessness.

Fate drove us there, Jane would say. No, it was the greedy landlord who sold our vacation house on Cape Cod, someone else would say, probably Skye.<br>Who knew which was right? But it was true that the beach house they usually rented had been sold at the last minute, and the Penderwicks were suddenly without summer plans. Mr. Penderwick called everywhere, but Cape Cod was booked solid, and his daughters were starting to think they would be spending their whole vacation at home in Cameron, Massachusetts. Not that they didn't love Cameron, but what is summer without a trip to somewhere special? Then, out of the blue, Mr. Penderwick heard through a friend of a friend about a cottage in the Berkshire Mountains. It had plenty of bedrooms and a big fenced-in pen for a dog--perfect for big, black, clumsy, lovable Hound Penderwick--and it was available to be rented for three weeks in August. Mr. Penderwick snatched it up, sight unseen.<br>He didn't know what he was getting us into, Batty would say. Rosalind always said, It's too bad Mommy never saw Arundel--she would have loved the gardens. And Jane would say, There are much better gardens in heaven. And Mommy will never have to bump into Mrs. Tifton in heaven, Skye added to make her sisters laugh. And laugh they would, and the talk would move on to other things, until the next time someone remembered Arundel.<br>But all that is in the future. When our story begins, Batty is still only four years old. Rosalind is twelve, Skye eleven, and Jane ten. They're in their car with Mr. Penderwick and Hound. The family is on the way to Arundel and, unfortunately, they're lost.<br>"It's Batty's fault," said Skye.<br>"It is not," said Batty.<br>"Of course it is," said Skye. "We wouldn't be lost if Hound hadn't eaten the map, and Hound wouldn't have eaten the map if you hadn't hidden your sandwich in it."<br>"Maybe it's fate that Hound ate the map. Maybe we'll discover something wonderful while we're lost," said Jane.<br>"We'll discover that when I'm in the backseat for too long with my younger sisters, I go insane and murder them," said Skye.<br>"Steady, troops," said Mr. Penderwick. "Rosalind, how about a game?"<br>"Let's do I Went to the Zoo and I Saw," said Rosalind. "I went to the zoo and I saw an anteater. Jane?"<br>"I went to the zoo and I saw an anteater and a buffalo," said Jane.<br>Batty was between Jane and Skye, so it was her turn next. "I went to the zoo and I saw an anteater, a buffalo, and a cangaroo."<br>"Kangaroo starts with a k, not a c," said Skye.<br>"It does not. It starts with a c, like cat," said Batty.<br>"Just take your turn, Skye," said Rosalind.<br>"There's no point in playing if we don't do it right." <br>Rosalind, who was sitting in the front seat with Mr. Penderwick, turned around and gave Skye her oldest-sister glare. It wouldn't do much, Rosalind knew. After all, Skye was only one year younger than she was. But it might quiet her long enough for Rosalind to concentrate on where they were going. They really were badly lost. This trip should have taken an hour and a half, and already they'd been on the road for three. Rosalind looked over at her father in the driver's seat. His glasses were slipping down his nose and he was humming his favorite Beethoven symphony, the one about spring. Rosalind knew this meant he was thinking about plants--he was a professor of botany--instead of about his driving.<br>"Daddy," she said, "what do you remember about the map?"<br>"We're supposed to go past a little town called Framley, then make a few turns and look for number eleven Stafford Street."<br>"Didn't we see Framley a while ago? And look," she said, pointing out the window. "We've been past those cows before."<br>"Good eyes, Rosy," he said. "But weren't we going in the other direction last time? Maybe this way will do the trick."<br>"No, because all we saw along here were more cow fields, remember?"<br>"Oh, yes." Mr. Penderwick stopped the car, turned it around, and went back the other way.<br>"We need to find someone who can give us directions," said Rosalind.<br>"We need to find a helicopter that can airlift us out of here," said Skye. "And keep your stupid wings to yourself!" She was talking to Batty, who, as always, was wearing her beloved orange-and-black butterfly wings.<br>"They're not stupid," said Batty.<br>"Woof," said Hound from his place among the boxes and suitcases in the very back of the car. He took Batty's side in every discussion.<br>"Lost and weary, the brave explorers and their faithful beast argued among themselves. Only Sabrina Starr remained calm," said Jane. Sabrina Starr was the heroine of books that Jane wrote. She rescued things. In the first book, it was a cricket. Then came Sabrina Starr Rescues a Baby Sparrow, Sabrina Starr Rescues a Turtle, and, most recently, Sabrina Starr Rescues a Groundhog. Rosalind knew that Jane was looking for ideas on what Sabrina should rescue next. Skye had suggested a man-eating crocodile, who would devour the heroine and put an end to the series, but the rest of the family had shouted her down. They enjoyed Jane's books.<br>There was a loud oomph in the backseat. Rosalind glanced around to make sure violence hadn't broken out, but it was only Batty struggling with her car seat--she was trying to twist herself backward to see Hound. Jane was jotting in her favorite blue notebook. So they were both all right. But Skye was blowing out her cheeks and imitating a fish, which meant she was even more bored than Rosalind had feared. They'd better find this cottage soon.<br>Then Rosalind spotted the truck pulled over by the side of the road. "Stop, Daddy! Maybe we can get directions."<br>Mr. Penderwick pulled over and Rosalind got out of the car. She now saw that the truck had TOMATOES painted in large letters on each of its doors. Next to the truck was a wooden table piled high with fat red tomatoes and, behind the table, an old man wearing worn blue jeans and a green shirt with Harry's Tomatoes embroidered across the pocket.<br>"Tomatoes?" he asked.<br>"Ask if they're magic tomatoes," Rosalind heard. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Skye hauling Jane back in through the car window.<br>"My younger sisters," said Rosalind apologetically to the old man.<br>"Had six of 'em myself."<br>Rosalind tried to imagine having six younger sisters, but she kept coming up with each of her sisters turned into twins. She shuddered and said, "Your tomatoes look delicious, but what I really need is directions. We're looking for number eleven Stafford Street."<br>"Arundel?"<br>"I don't know about any Arundel. We're supposed to be renting a cottage at that address."<br>"That's Arundel, Mrs. Tifton's place. Beautiful woman. Snooty as all get-out, too."<br>"Oh, dear."<br>"You'll be fine. There are a couple of nice surprises over there. You're going to have to keep that blond one under control, though," he said, nodding toward the car, where Skye and Jane were now leaning out of the window together, listening. Muffled complaints could be heard from Batty, who was being squashed.<br>"Why me?" called Skye.<br>The man winked at Rosalind. "I can always spot the troublemakers. I was one myself. Now, tell your dad to go down this road a little ways, take the first left, then a quick right, and look for number eleven."<br>"Thank you," said Rosalind, and turned to go.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning 1st Edition</h2><p>Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning introduces the reader to the latest developments in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning.

One morning while he was hunting in the Badlands with his brother Drey, his father and chief&nbsp; were slain back at camp. When he and his brother returned to Blackhail they found that Mace Blackhail, the chief&#x2019;s foster son, had declared himself head of the clan. Mace blamed the murders on Vaylo Bludd, chief of a rival clan. When Bludd sacked the Dhoone house of rival clan Dhoone a week later, Mace&#x2019;s story of Bludd aggression gained credibility. Raif found himself isolated. He alone believed that Mace Blackhail was a liar and a chief- killer. <br>War against clan Bludd followed, as Hailsmen sought to avenge their chief&#x2019;s death. When Mace received word that a caravan of Bluddsmen were on the road, heading east to occupy the Dhoonehouse, he ordered an attack. Raif rode with the ambush party. When he discovered the caravan contained women and children, not warriors, he refused to participate in the slaughter. For disobeying an order on the field and de�serting his fellow clansmen in battle, Raif was branded a traitor to his clan. Four days later, Raif left Blackhail in the company of his uncle Angus Lok. His oath to protect Blackhail was now broken, even while he had sought to act with faith and loyalty. <br>The two men headed south. Upon arrival at Duff&#x2019;s stove house, they learned news of the massacre on the Bluddroad had preceded them. When challenged by a group of Bludd warriors, Raif admitted to being present during the slaughter. He told no one that he took no part in the massacre; loyalty to his clan prevented him from defending himself at their expense. With this admission, however, Raif forever damned him�self in the eyes of Bluddsmen. He was the only Hailsmen they knew for a certainty who was present during the slaughter. <br>When Angus and Raif arrived at the city Spire Vanis they rescued a young woman named Ash March who was being hunted down by the city&#x2019;s Protector General, Mara.ce Eye. Angus had a strong reaction when he saw the girl and immediately put himself in danger to save her. Raif&#x2019;s skill with a bow proved invaluable. He&nbsp; single- handedly rescued the girl by shooting arrows through her pursuers&#x2019; hearts. <br>As Raif, Ash and Angus headed north to the city of Ille Glaive, Raif learned that Ash was the foster daughter of the Surlord of Spire Vanis. She had run away when she learned that her foster father intended to imprison her in the city&#x2019;s citadel, the Inverted Spire. Heritas Cant, a friend of Angus Lok&#x2019;s, provided the explanation for the Surlord&#x2019;s be�havior. Cant told Ash she was the first Reach to be born in a thousand years. She alone possessed the ability to unlock the Blind, the prison without a key that contained the destructive might of the immortal End-lords. Cant warned Ash she must discharge her&nbsp; Reach- power or die. <br>Raif and Angus agreed to accompany Ash to the Cavern of Black Ice, the one place where she could discharge her power without tearing a hole in the Blindwall that holds back the Endlords. As soon as their small party reentered the clanholds they&nbsp; were captured by Bluddsmen. The Bludd chief had lost seventeen grandchildren on the Bluddroad, and he was determined to make Raif Sevrance pay for those losses. After days of torture, Raif developed a fever and began to fail. Yet when Death came to take him she changed her mind. &#x201c;Perhaps I won&#x2019;t take you yet,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;You fight in my image and live in my shadow, and if I leave you where you are you&#x2019;ll provide much fresh meat for my chil�dren. Kill an army for me, Raif Sevrance. Any less and I just might call you back.&#x201d; <br>The next day Raif was saved by a group of Hailish warriors led by his brother Drey. &#x201c;We part here. For always,&#x201d; Drey said as he let his younger brother, the traitor, slip away. <br>Later that day Raif met up with Ash, who had escaped from Marafice Eye by using her&nbsp; Reach- power. The Dog Lord had handed her over to Eye in repayment for a debt. Penthero Iss, the Surlord of Spire Vanis, had aided Vaylo&#x2019;s taking of the Dhoonehouse, and Vaylo had come to regret Iss&#x2019; sorcerous help. Ash March was payment in full. <br>Ash&#x2019;s health deteriorated during the journey to the cavern. When she collapsed in the snow, Raif drew a guide circle and called on the Stone Gods for help. Two members of the ancient Sull people, Far Riders named Mal Naysayer and Ark Veinsplitter, heard this call, and rode to Ash&#x2019;s aid. Upon seeing her, they suspected that Ash was the Reach. They also suspected that Raif was Mor Drakka, Watcher of the Dead; the one predicted to destroy the Sull. <br>The Far Riders took Ash and Raif to a frozen river that led to the Cavern of Black Ice and then departed. Ash discharged her power, but it was already too late. By blasting Marafice Eye&#x2019;s men in the Bitter Hills, she had caused a rent in the Blindwall. Back in her home city of Spire Vanis, a nameless sorcerer who had been enslaved by her foster father was already working to open the breach. &#x201c;Push and we will give you your name,&#x201d; the Endlords promised him. Bound by chains, broken and tortured, the sorcerer accepted the deal. &#x201c;Baralis,&#x201d; the Endlords named the sorcerer as he broke open the wall. <br>Meanwhile the clan wars were escalating. Blackhail waged war on Bludd to avenge the killing of the Hail chief; Bludd fought Blackhail for the slaying of its women and children; and Dhoone, dispossessed of its round house by Bludd, fought to regain its territory. With the help of his&nbsp; half- brother Bram, Robbie Dun Dhoone claimed the Dhoone chiefship and retook Dhoone from the Dog Lord. Due to the desertion of his second son, Pengo, the Dog Lord had been holding the Dhoone�house with a skeleton force. He, his remaining two grandchildren and his lady Nan escaped and headed north toward an old hillfort where his fostered&nbsp; son- Cluff Drybannock was stationed with two hundred men. <br>In order to secure sufficient manpower to retake Dhoone, Robbie sold his brother to the Milk chief, Wrayan Castlemilk, forcing Bram to leave his clan. Bram was made welcome at Castlemilk, but his taste for intrigue&#x2014; acquired in negotiations with Skinner Dhoone and the Dog Lord&#x2014; made him break his oath and join the Phage, a shadowy broth�erhood that aimed to defend the world against the Endlords. <br>Blackhail took possession of Ganmiddich, but lost it when an army led by Marafice Eye broke the Crab Gate that protected it. When news of Penthero Iss&#x2019; death reached the battlefield, half of Eye&#x2019;s forces fied the field to rush back to Spire Vanis and vie for power, leaving Eye at the mercy of a&nbsp; newly- arrived army led by Pengo Bluddfi Bludd took Ganmiddich. Marafice Eye led his injured&nbsp; army&#x2014; plus four hostages taken from Blackhail&#x2014; home to Spire Vanis where his&nbsp; father- in- law Roland Stornoway was holding power on his behalffi With Stornoway&#x2019;s support, Eye became surlord. <br>Back at Blackhail, the slain chief&#x2019;s widow, Raina Blackhail, strug�gled to come to terms with her new life. Like Raif, she suspected that Mace, her foster son, was responsible for her husband&#x2019;s murder, and she did not support his chiefship. After her husband&#x2019;s murder, Mace raped her in the Oldwood and then told clansmen it was consensual. Raina married him rather than risk her reputation and status, becoming chief&#x2019;s wife for the second time. While Mace was away at war with Bludd and Dhoone, Raina quietly began to claim power. When Stannig Beade arrived from Scarpe to replace Blackhail&#x2019;s guide who had been killed in the explosion of the Hailstone, Raina suspected he had been sent to watch her. Tension ran high as Beade began acting as chief. When Anwyn Bird, Raina&#x2019;s oldest friend, was assassinated in cold blood it was the final straw. Guessing that Anwyn had been murdered to si�lence dissension, and fearing for her own life, Raina Blackhail did the only thing she could to protect her clan. She entered the chief&#x2019;s chamber one night and killed Stannig Beade. <br>After departing Blackhail, Angus Lok returned to his home east of Ille Glaive. Upon arrival he found his worst nightmare had come to life: His&nbsp; house had been burned down. His three daughters and his wife&nbsp; were gone. Dead. Angus was a ranger, a member of the Phage. He blamed himself for leading evil to his door. <br>Ash and Raif, once they left the Cavern of Black Ice, headed north into Ice Trapper territory. Ash left Raif while he slept, departing in the company of Mal Naysayer and Ark Veinsplitter. She chose to have her blood drained, a ritual cleansing that would allow her to become Sull. When she and the Far Riders&nbsp; were attacked by Unmade forces at Float�ing Bridge, Veinsplitter was killed and Ash became separated from the Naysayer. As she traveled alone in Sull territory she met a stranger named Lan Fallstar who told her he would take her to the Heart of the Sull. They became lovers, but he betrayed her, leading her into a trap. Know�ing that she was a Reach, Fallstar wanted only to harness the power of her body to kill the Unmade. The Naysayer found Ash just in time to save her from Fallstar&#x2019;s assassins, and together they headed south to the Heart of Sull. <br>Raif joined the Maimed Men, an outlaw clan who lived in the cliffs above the&nbsp; Rift&#x2014; the deep cleft in the earth&#x2019;s crust through which the Unmade sometimes escaped to attack mortal men. Traggis Mole, the leader of the Maimed Men, sent Raif to raid Blackhail as a test of Raif&#x2019;s loyalty to the Maimed Men. As the raid party left the mine known as Black Hole, Raif was challenged by his old friend and clans�men Bitty Shank. Raif killed Bitty to escape, and then .ed into the Great Want, the waste at the center of the continent. He was lost for a time. <br>Meanwhile, Ef.e Sevrance, Raif&#x2019;s&nbsp; nine- year- old sister, had been forced to leave her clan. Ef.e had been born to the stone lore and was able to tell when bad things&nbsp; were about to happen. She was an unwit�ting witness when Raina was raped by Mace, and Raina feared this knowledge made Ef.e vulnerable. Seeking to remove the girl from Mace&#x2019;s sights, Raina sent Ef.e to Clan Dregg. Ef.e never made it. She was kidnapped by boatmen from cursed Clan Gray. On the journey to Clan Gray she met Chedd Lime house, who had also been kidnapped, and fell into the Wolf River, where a pike snapped the stone lore from around her throat. <br>Raif was found in the Great Want by the lamb brothers, who&nbsp; were there searching for the souls of their undead.

To show the German Catholic Church's congeniality with some of the goals of National Socialism and its gradual entrapment in Nazi policies and programs, Lewy describes the episcopate's support of Hitler's expansionist policies and its failures to speak out on the persecution of the Jews. To this tragic history Lewy brings new focus and research, illuminating one of the darkest corners of our century with scholarship and intellectual honesty in a riveting, and often painful, narrative.</p><p><b>Guenter Lewy</b> left his native Germany in 1939 at the age of fifteen, emigrating to Palestine and then to the U.S. He has been on the faculties of Columbia University, Smith College, and the University of Massachusetts and is the author of <i>Religion and Revolution, America in Vietnam, The Cause That Failed,</i> and <i>The Nazi Persecution of the Gypsies.</i>"The tragic failure of the Catholic Church to live up to its moral canons in the confrontation with Nazism is traced in shattering detail in this disturbing book." -- <i>The New York Review of Books</i></p><h2>Polterheist (Esther Diamond Novel)</h2><p>In the days leading up to Christmas, struggling actress Esther Diamond is working as a singing-and-dancing elf at Fenster &amp; Co, a major Manhattan department store.

Already the machinery had been set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributed among the peasants.&#x201d; &#x2013; John Reed John Reed&#x2019;s Ten Days that Shook the World, published in 1922, is a gripping account of the Russian Revolution that took place just years earlier in the midst of World War I. Of course, nobody knew at the time just how important the Russian Revolution would be geopolitically, especially with the advent of the Cold War less than 25 years later. Reed&#x2019;s account was firsthand; as a journalist, he was in Russia when the Revolution transpired. The book was popular and influential enough that it made the rounds among Russia&#x2019;s leadership, with Stalin himself arguing against some of Reed&#x2019;s theses.</p><p>The situation in St. Petersburg was growing more and more tense. The People's Revolution had begun by overthrowing the corrupt Tsarist regime in March 1917, but the workers and the peasants felt the revolution had much farther to go. Tired of fighting a war that meant little to them, the soldiers also grew restless: "When the land belongs to the peasants, and the factories to the workers, and the power to the Soviets, then we'll know we have something to fight for, and we'll fight for it!"<p> Lenin pressed the Bolsheviks to seize power. On the night of October 24, an organized mass of workers, soldiers, peasants, and sailors stormed the Winter Palace. On the following day, at the opening of the second Congress of Soviets, Trotsky announced the overthrow of the provisional government. Counterrevolutionary forces marched on the capital, but the Revolutionary Army triumphed. After all, "[t]his was <i>their</i> battle, for <i>their</i> world; the officers in command were elected by <i>them</i>. For the moment that incoherent multiple will was one will."</p><p> In <i>Ten Days That Shook the World</i> John Reed tells the story of Red October and the Russian revolution from a unique, firsthand perspective. Reed, an American journalist, was on assignment in Russia for <i>The Masses</i>--then the principal radical journal in the United States--and spent his days walking the streets, reading and collecting handbills, newspapers, and posters, and talking to people. As a result, <i>Ten Days</i> crackles with energetic immediacy. At its best moments it reads like a novel: Reed recounts conversations and arguments, details political machinations, and speculates on personal motives. Though this is no mere piece of propaganda, Reed's enthusiasm for the revolution infuses the text (some readers may be put off by Reed's florid prose), casting each counterrevolutionary act in a negative light. Helpful notes flesh out the background for those less familiar with the preceding events and render this a solid work of history. <i>Ten Days That Shook the World</i> is a stirring account of a stirring event. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><b>John Reed (1887-1920)</b> was a journalist, activist, poet, and author. In addition to chronicling the Russian revolution, he reported on US labor strikes, the Mexican revolution, World War I, and was a founder of and international delegate for the Communist Labor Party.

Kaplan listened to his truck-driver father tell evocative stories about traveling across America in his youth, travels in which he learned to understand the country literally from the ground up. There was a specific phrase from Kaplan&#x2019;s childhood that captured this perspective: A westward traveler must &#x201c;earn the Rockies&#x201d; by driving&#x2014;not flying&#x2014;across the flat Midwest and Great Plains.<br><br> In <i>Earning the Rockies,</i> Kaplan undertakes his own cross-country journey to recapture an appreciation of American geography often lost in the jet age. Traveling west, in the same direction as the pioneers, Kaplan traverses a rich and varied landscape that remains the primary source of American power. Along the way, he witnesses both prosperity and decline&#x2014;increasingly cosmopolitan cities that thrive on globalization, impoverished towns denuded by the loss of manufacturing&#x2014;and paints a bracingly clear picture of America today.<br><br> The history of westward expansion is examined here in a new light&#x2014;as a story not just of genocide and individualism, but also of communalism and a respect for the limits of a water-starved terrain, a frontier experience that bent our national character toward pragmatism. Kaplan shows how the great midcentury works of geography and geopolitics by Bernard DeVoto, Walter Prescott Webb, and Wallace Stegner are more relevant today than ever before. Concluding his journey at Naval Base San Diego, Kaplan looks out across the Pacific Ocean to the next frontier: China, India, and the emerging nations of Asia. And in the final chapter, he provides a gripping description of an anarchic world and explains why America&#x2019;s foreign policy response ought to be rooted in its own geographical situation.<br><br> In this short, intense meditation on the American landscape, Robert D. Kaplan reminds us of an overlooked source of American strength: the fact that we are a nation, empire, and continent all at once. <i>Earning the Rockies </i>is an urgent reminder of how a nation&#x2019;s geography still foreshadows its future, and how we must reexamine our own landscape in order to confront the challenges that lie before us.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Earning the Rockies</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;There is more insight here into the Age of Trump than in bushels of political-horse-race journalism. . . . <i>Earning the Rockies</i> is a tonic, because it brings fundamentals back into view.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review </i>(Editors&#x2019; Choice)</b><br><br> &#x201c;A sui generis writer . . .

He was born in Brooklyn in 1909. I don&#x2019;t recall him ever at peace with his life. I do remember him looking serene once at Valley Forge, among the oaks and maples and magnolias; clustered among the numerous birches and pine trees; and a second time among other hardwoods at Fredericksburg. These are trees I could not name when I was young but learned to identify on later visits to those hallowed sites, and to other sites on the Eastern Seaboard that the memory of my father inspired me to see. For it was only at such places, away from our immediate surroundings, that my father became real to me, and real to himself.<br><br>In particular, I remember him at Wheatland, James Buchanan&#x2019;s handsome Federal-style home with the air of a southern plantation in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. There I peeked my chin over the protective barriers into sumptuous mid-nineteenth-century rooms, with their dark walnut desks and other antique furniture, along with the French china, glittering crystal, and gilded mirrors. Yes, I remember a grand piano there and many shadowy bookcases and lithographs. For long spans of my childhood my memory is vague, but it lights up with minute detail about what matters most to me. Wheatland, where President Buchanan lived, worked, headquartered his campaign for high office, and died, really mattered to me as a child. I was only nine, but my father in those rare moments spoke to me almost as though I were an adult, even as he was so full of tenderness.<br><br>My father laid out the fundamentals of Buchanan&#x2019;s failure as president, perhaps the worst in our history: a story necessarily simplified for a nine-year-old. Of course, later in life I would fill in most of the details.<br><br>Whatever the multitude of factors in the three-way election of 1856, James Buchanan was by no means an accidental president. When he assumed office in March 1857, he appeared to have everything going for him. Arguably, no man in the country was better qualified for the task of calming the festering North-South split over slavery. He was a tall, reasonably wealthy, self-made, and imposing figure, someone who, aside from being a bachelor, was truly good at life: a former congressman, senator, minister to Russia in the Andrew Jackson administration, secretary of state in the James K. Polk administration, and minister to Great Britain in the Franklin Pierce administration; a talented and accomplished operator, a man of maneuver gifted at the fine art of compromise despite his stubbornness. He knew what buttons to push, in other words. Who else was possessed of the political savvy necessary to save the Union? Few were shrewder. Except for one thing, as it would turn out: Buchanan did not have a compass point toward which to navigate in the midst of all the deals he tried to make, and he had a distinct and fatal sympathy for the South. But mostly he was all ambition and technique without direction. Moreover, he was a literalist. He had a small vision of the Constitution and the frontier nation: he did not believe he and the federal government had the right to dictate terms to the southern states. He saw the good in both the pro-slavery and anti-slavery points of view. With his legalistic flair, he might have made a very competent president in more ordinary times; he was a disaster in extraordinary times. The country finally came apart under his watch. &#x201c;It turned out, he just, ehhh, didn&#x2019;t have what it takes,&#x201d; a father whispered to a nine-year-old boy at Wheatland.<br><br>The basic security of the world in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries has depended greatly upon the political unity of the temperate zone of North America. And that almost didn&#x2019;t happen. It was my knowledge of both Buchanan&#x2019;s many gifts and his abject personal failure as president&#x2014;a knowledge first granted me by my father&#x2014;that provided me with a deeper awareness of just how difficult making epochal decisions in the moment of crisis can be. It was this very awareness about Buchanan&#x2014;how good he looked at the beginning of his administration and how bad he turned out&#x2014;that always made me think later in life, Thank God we had Lincoln. What Buchanan ultimately lacked, despite his r�sum�, Lincoln had in abundance: character.<br><br>But Buchanan&#x2019;s failure was secondary in my father&#x2019;s eyes that day at Wheatland; primary was the fact that Buchanan was, nevertheless, part of the vital tapestry of American history. Therefore, he was well worth knowing about. Great presidents cannot be understood in isolation; one requires knowledge of the not-great presidents who preceded and succeeded them. Indeed, we need always to see history as a whole, we cannot appreciate the good without knowing the bad, and vice versa. This is especially true of westward expansion. Wheatland made America&#x2019;s past come alive for me.<br><br>It was at a hotel in Lancaster during that same trip that my parents bought me a volume of American travel articles written in easy Reader&#x2019;s Digest style, suited to my age. One story was about a family driving west and stopping for breakfast at a diner somewhere in Nebraska perhaps, on the Great Plains (or the Great American Desert as it was once known), anticipating the sight of the Rocky Mountains, where they were headed. &#x201c;You have to earn the Rockies,&#x201d; the father says to his wife and children, in my piercing if inaccurate childhood recollection of the story, by driving across the flat Midwest and Plains. Perhaps it was &#x201c;meet the challenge of the Rockies.&#x201d; In any case, earn the Rockies is a phrase that has stayed with me my whole life. It sums up America&#x2019;s continental geography, the continent that Lincoln united and realized, and the significance of the Rocky Mountains as a geographical fact that should only be encountered by first crossing the Eastern Seaboard, the Middle West, and the Great American Desert, for that was the way that they were encountered in all their sudden and terrifying magnificence by European settlers and pathfinders, those who could not have known what exactly lay over the horizon.<br><br>Throughout my childhood I yearned to see mountains higher than the Appalachians. As a family, we never left the eastern states. The Rockies were just too far, and my parents simply lacked the means, though my father talked about them often. The phrase earn the Rockies helped spur me to travel, something also instilled in me by my father since I can remember.<br><br>My mother and father took me on that trip through Pennsylvania in 1962. Alaska and Hawaii had only recently been admitted to the Union. The United States back then, for a while yet, still thought of itself as only a continental nation, stretching, according to both the song and the clich�, from sea to shining sea. To this day, Alaskans refer to the rest of the country as &#x201c;the Lower 48,&#x201d; meaning the contiguous forty-eight states that constitute the temperate zone of North America. Arizona was the last of the Lower 48, admitted to the Union only in 1912, a little closer in time to that trip through Pennsylvania than that trip through Pennsylvania was to the moment at which I write.<br><br>America was a different country then, vaster and emptier. Valley Forge was not in the suburbs of Greater Philadelphia as it is now, nor Fredericksburg near the suburbs of Greater Washington, D.C. Food was more distinctive&#x2014;with far fewer chain restaurants and grits widespread in eating facilities just south of the nation&#x2019;s capital. People drove and rode buses, or hitchhiked across America&#x2014;as I did in the summer of 1970&#x2014;much more often than they flew. The Interstate Highway System was spanking new, and thus the Pennsylvania Turnpike and New York State Thruway constituted exotic experiences, with rest stops offering sit-down dining with waiters and waitresses. Those magical highways could transport you from the Atlantic Seaboard all the way to the very rim of the Midwest! The East Coast was much more of an adventure then than it is now. And there were few crowds anywhere.<br><br>It had its dark side, though. I remember stopping for lunch with my parents at a restaurant called Lowery&#x2019;s in Tappahannock, Virginia. It was the spring of 1964, just a few months before the Civil Rights Act, and we were returning north from a visit to the Yorktown Battlefield. There was a sign at the entrance as we opened the door: &#x201c;Whites Only.&#x201d; I saw my parents look uneasily at each other, something that communicated fear to an eleven-year-old boy. We went inside, ate quietly, and noticed everyone glancing at us. It was clear that we were not locals and therefore not entirely welcome.<br><br>Those trips were the gemstones of my childhood. It is in the midst of recalling them that I cherish the memory of my parents the most. Returning from those trips I was able to see, as though a shocked outsider, the grainy, almost black-and-white surroundings of our home in Queens: the sooty fire escape and other blockhouse apartments were the only view from the stifling kitchen where we ate. Because of the clash between where we had been and where we lived, those early travels, I believe, burdened me with something I was never entirely comfortable with: a cruel objectivity. In the morning we had been at Wheatland seeing the feast of glittering greenery outside James Buchanan&#x2019;s mansion; that same night we were back in our apartment, hearing the yelling of our neighbors in other apartments. Seeing the wider world, if only a glimpse of it, had come with a price. I learned early that comparison is painful and not always polite, but it is at the root of all serious analysis.<br><br>My father was a truck driver with a high school education who listened to classical music on WQXR while breezing through the New York Times Sunday and weekday crossword puzzles. He had a small record collection that included the patriotic band music of John Philip Sousa and the hits of Al Jolson, mixed with a little Stephen Foster. It was music that took you from the mid-nineteenth century to the first decades of the twentieth, telegraphing the country&#x2019;s latent dynamism as it crept toward World War II. There was also in this singular and awkward repertoire the haunting twangs of Ferde Grof�&#x2019;s Grand Canyon Suite from 1931, with their hopeful intimations of travel. In the 1960s, my father was decades behind his time. As I grew into middle age, I realized how grateful I was for it.<br><br>In the spring of 1961, my father took my family, including my older brother and a cousin, on a trip to Washington, D.C. It was particularly memorable because on the second night he got us tickets to hear the Marine Band play Sousa at Constitution Hall. Between such transformative moments&#x2014;Wheatland, the Marine Band&#x2014;was the weeping undertow of my childhood: every late afternoon, my father, hunched over the unmade bed that was visible from the windows of apartment houses directly across, tying the laces on his work boots, lost briefly in a trance, preparing for another night of driving in the partial wasteland of Brooklyn. Facing him in the bedroom was his small collection of books, two shelves actually. I remember The Conquest of Everest by Sir John Hunt (1954), Beyond the High Himalayas by William O. Douglas (1952), Jefferson the Virginian by Dumas Malone (1948), and one he had just bought, and that he anticipated reading: Travels with Charley: In Search of America by John Steinbeck (1962).<br><br>In the 1930s my father had spent his twenties riding railway cars around the United States, earning a living as a horse-racing tout in forty-three of the lower forty-eight states. After a &#x201c;big score&#x201d; he would check into a first-class hotel, a large cigar in hand: twenty-four hours later, he would be living a hobo&#x2019;s existence like so many others in the 1930s. He filled me with stories of his escapades in Depression-era America, and of the predominant image of a still-pastoral and na�ve nation, where the scams he ran were relatively innocent and people bought you a meal when you were down and out. I have a picture of him, powerful in the way of a photo negative, with a jacket and tie and sharp fedora, wearing a confident smile with which I could never associate him when I was a child, taken at the Texas State Fair in Dallas: the year &#x201c;1933&#x201d; emblazoned above him.<br><br>Beulah Park (Columbus, Ohio), Arlington Downs (Dallas&#x2013;Fort Worth), Churchill Downs, where he watched Bold Venture win the Kentucky Derby in 1936&#x2014;my father knew literally every racetrack in the country. There were Houston and New Orleans in the winter of 1933&#x2013;34; by freight train (the Union Pacific) from Pittsburgh to Chicago to Las Vegas the following year; sick, broke, back on his feet. It was an epic existence, however aimless, seedy, and pathetic at the edges, as well as full of exaggeration in the telling.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s last memory of travel was in 1942. He had just completed basic training at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and was heading north on a troop train for dispatch to Europe, where he would serve in the U.S. Army Eighth Air Force in England. At a rail junction near Cairo, Illinois, the sun was setting in rich colors over the prairie. Other trains were then converging from several tracks onto a single line that would take the troops to points along the East Coast, where ships to Europe awaited. Across a wide arc, the only thing he saw were trains and more trains, with soldiers looking out through every window as each train curved toward the others against a flat and limitless landscape lit red by the sun. &#x201c;Just looking at that scene, that&#x2019;s the moment when I knew we were going to win the war,&#x201d; he said to me, smiling briefly at the recollection as he completed tying his shoelaces.<br><br>My first map of the United States was composed of my father&#x2019;s images. It was a landscape full of lessons and marvels that I desperately wanted to experience firsthand. The flat prairie was something I never imagined as dull but, rather, as an immense and magnificent prelude to something grander. I thank my father for that. And thus I would make several journeys from coast to coast: once in my late teens, hitchhiking, fueled with curiosity, obsessed with just seeing the West; then as a middle-aged journalist, writing about social, regional, and environmental issues; and now, finally, in my middle sixties, somewhat chastened by international events, hoping to learn something about America&#x2019;s place in the world by simply looking at the country around me.</p><h2>Theros Ironfeld (Dragonlance Warriors, Vol. 4)</h2><p>A young boy stood on the dock of his fishing village and watched the minotaur war barge approach.

The three volumes of The Smoking Diaries are the result, in which one of Britain&#39;s most amusing and original writers reflects on a life filled with cigarettes (continuing), alcohol (stopped), several triumphs and many more disasters, shame, adultery, friendship and love. Few diarists have been as frank about themselves, and even fewer as entertaining. This beautiful boxed set contains paperbacks of The Smoking Diaries, The Smoking Diaries: The Year of the Jouncer and The Smoking Diaries: The Last Cigarette. With their combination of comedy and serious reflection, of sharp observation and painful self-disclosure, Simon Gray&#39;s diaries have reinvented the memoir form and are destined to become classics of autobiography. The beauty of them lies in Gray&#39;s struggle to put a finger on some kind of personal truth: The Smoking Diaries offer a brilliant and moving account of life&#39;s unsteady progress - with unfailing wit and humour, they take us to the very heart of a man.</p><p>SIMON GRAY was born in England in 1936 and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was the author of over 30 plays, including Butley, The Common Pursuit and Cell Mates, and published several volumes of diaries and books about the theatre, including Enter a Fox and Fat Chance, both published by Granta. He was awarded a CBE in 2005. He died in 2008.About to celebrate his 66th birthday, Gray, the British author of more than 30 plays, including the forthcoming Broadway revival of <i>Butley </i>(which will star Nathan Lane), started writing this witty journal of passing time, missed opportunities and his personality quirks, with the underlying topic of his smoking three packs of cigarettes daily and the wheezing and dizziness that accompany his habit. He traces his romance with tobacco to the incessant smoking of his overaffectionate Mummy and emotionally distant Daddy, and to his savvy 1940s and '50s childhood spent as part of a girl-run kiddie gang in Montreal. Gray's funny vignettes introduce characters such as Mr. and Mrs. Alzheimer (he suffers from the disease; she, therefore, is an "Alzheimer widow"), and "schoolmaster floggers" Mr. Brown and Mr. Burn. While somberly noting the demise of his parents and several friends from smoking-relating cancer and emphysema, Gray keeps up a constant comedy routine about the British literary world, his claustrophobia in cars and trains, the TV series <i>Law and Order</i> and other random subjects. His memoir is a dark comedy, full of intimacy, limericks, wisdom and fun. Photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One passing remark can set off a long and pleasant reminiscence, as Jeanne Chesanow discovered when she published requests for children's plant lore and games. Hundreds of people wrote to share childhood diversions that were remembered with obvious joy. And it's a joy to read about them, for these gentle recollections bring back a time most of us have almost forgotten, a world where days were long, plants smelled delicious, and the mind could drift over endless possibilities.<br><br>The firsthand anecdotes Jeanne Chesanow collected, plus writings gleaned from American and European authors, make up this most unusual little volume. Whether read for its nostalgic charm or used as a source of pastimes for today's children, <i>Honeysuckle Sipping</i> renews one's sense of wonder and pleasure in simple things.</p><p></p><h2>Jane Eyre: Authoritative Text, Backgrounds, Criticism (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p>Jane Eyre is a wildly emotional romance with a lonely heroine and a tormented Byronic hero, pathetic orphans, dark secrets, and a madwoman in the attic. When it was <br>published in 1847, it was a great popular success. The power of the writing, the masterly <br>handling of the narrative, and the boldly realistic style were much admired. But many found it difficult to believe that Currer Bell, the pseudonymous author, was Charlotte Bront� , a young woman from a bleak Yorkshire parsonage.</p><p></p><h2>The Siege of Krishnapur</h2><p>In the Spring of 1857, with India on the brink of a violent and bloody mutiny, Krishnapur is a remote town on the vast North Indian plain. For the British there, life is orderly and genteel. Then the sepoys at the nearest military cantonment rise in revolt and the British community retreats with shock into the Residency. They prepare to fight for their lives with what weapons they can muster. As food and ammunition grow short, the Residency, its defences battered by shot and shell and eroded by the rains, becomes ever more vulnerable.The Siege of Krishnapur is a modern classic of narrative excitement that also digs deep to explore some fundamental questions of civilisation and life.</p><p><i>"The first sign of trouble at Krishnapur came with a mysterious distribution of chapatis, made of coarse flour and about the size and thickness of a biscuit; towards the end of February 1857, they swept the countryside like an epidemic."</i> <p> Students of history will recognize 1857 as the year of the Sepoy rebellion in India--an uprising of native soldiers against the British, brought on by Hindu and Muslim recruits' belief that the rifle cartridges they were provided had been greased with pig or cow fat. This seminal event in Anglo-Indian relations provides the backdrop for J.G. Farrell's Booker Prize-winning exploration of race, culture, and class, <i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i>. </p><p> Like the mysteriously appearing chapatis, life in British India seems, on the surface, innocuous enough. Farrell introduces us gradually to a large cast of characters as he paints a vivid portrait of the Victorians' daily routines that are accompanied by heat, boredom, class consciousness, and the pursuit of genteel pastimes intended for cooler climates. Even the siege begins slowly, with disquieting news of massacres in cities far away. When Krishnapur itself is finally attacked, the Europeans withdraw inside the grounds of the Residency where very soon conditions begin to deteriorate: food and water run out, disease is rampant, people begin to go a little mad. Soon the very proper British are reduced to eating insects and consorting across class lines. Farrell's descriptions of life inside the Residency are simultaneously horrifying and blackly humorous. The siege, for example, is conducted under the avid eyes of the local populace, who clearly anticipate an enjoyable massacre and thus arrive every morning laden with picnic lunches (plainly visible to the starving Europeans). By turns witty and compassionate, <i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i> comprises the best of all fictional worlds: unforgettable characters, an epic adventure, and at its heart a cultural clash for the ages. Quite simply, this is a splendid novel. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>J.G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 and spent a good deal of his life abroad, including periods in France and North America, and then settled in London where he wrote most of his novels.Among his novels, TROUBLES won the Faber Memorial Prize in 1970 and the Lost Man Booker prize in 2010 and THE SIEGE OF KRISHNAPUR won the Booker Prize in 1973.In April 1979 he went to live in County Cork where only four months later he was drowned in a fishing accident.</p><h2>Rabbi Paul: An Intellectual Biography</h2><p><p>A brilliant new biography of Saint Paul, whose interpretations of the life and teachings of Jesus transformed a loosely organized, grassroots peasant movement into the structured religion we know today<br><br>Without Paul, there would be no Christianity. His letters to various churches scattered throughout the Roman Empire articulated, for the first time, the beliefs that make up the heart of Christian practice and faith. In this extraordinary biography, Bruce Chilton explains the changing images of Paul, from the early Church period when he was regarded as the premiere apostle who separated Christianity from Judaism to more recent liberal evaluations, which paint him as an antifeminist, homophobic figure more dedicated to doctrine than to spiritual freedom. By illuminating Paul&#x2019;s thoughts and contributions within the context of his time, Chilton restores him to his place as the founding architect of the Church and one of the most important figures in Western history. <br><br><i>Rabbi Paul</i> is at once a compelling, highly readable biography and a window on how Jesus&#x2019; message was transformed into a religion embraced by millions around the world. Drawing on Paul&#x2019;s own writings as well as historical and scholarly documents about his life and times, Chilton portrays an all-too-human saint who helped to create both the most beautiful and the most troublesome aspects of the Church. He shows that Paul sought to specify the correct approach to such central concerns as sexuality, obedience, faith, conscience, and spirit, to define religion as an institution, and to clarify the nature of the religious personality&#x2014;issues that Christians still struggle with today.</p></p><p><p>Praise for <i>Rabbi Jesus:</i>&#x201c;Bruce Chilton&#x2019;s masterpiece of religious narrative marks a genuinely new and important step beyond the now-faltering historical Jesus movement.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jacob Neusner, <i>The Jerusalem Post</i>&#x201c;Open this book and see Jesus as you&#x2019;ve never seen him. . . .

This new translation by Burton Pike is a reaction to overly stylized previous translations, and aims to capture not only the beauty but also the strangeness, the spirit, of Rilke's German.</p></p><p>This is the definitive, widely acclaimed translation of the major prose work of one of our century's greatest poets -- "a masterpiece like no other" (Elizabeth Hardwick) -- Rilke's only novel, extraordinary for its structural uniqueness and purity of language. First published in 1910, it has proven to be one of the most influential and enduring works of fiction of our century.<br><br>Malte Laurids Brigge is a young Danish nobleman and poet living in Paris. Obsessed with death and with the reality that lurks behind appearances, Brigge muses on his family and their history and on the teeming, alien life of the city. Many of the themes and images that occur in Rilke's poetry can also be found in the novel, prefiguring the modernist movement in its self-awareness and imagistic immediacy.It is a book of quiet, close-knit prose studded with unforgettable scenes, set forth here in precise, analytical descriptions, there in intense, lyrical flights of near- poetry. It is uniquely Rilke and touches the reader with the same sudden revelations and uncanny awareness as do his poems.</p><h2>Wisdom&#39;s Daughters: Stories of Women Around Jesus</h2><p>Tells the life of Jesus through the real and imagined accounts of Mary Magdalene, Elizabeth, Martha, Mary the Mother, and ten other women</p><p></p><h2>Altar Boy: A Story Of Life After Abuse</h2><p>The day Andrew Madden was molested by his favorite priest, his love of the Catholic Church was poisoned. The abuse lasted for three years, until Andrew was fifteen, and its impact went on long after. Andrew lost direction, self-esteem, and the capacity to love. Eventually, he lost himself in drink. <i>Altar Boy</i> tells how Andrew found his way again. This candid and sometimes searing account of how abuse can affect a life also shows that victims don't have to remain victims.</p><p>Andrew Madden is an IT consultant and lives in Dublin.</p><h2>Chemistry Teacher 4th Edition</h2><p>The Chemistry Teacher&#39;s Edition, 4th ed., features standard full-color, reduced-sized student-text pages with wrap-around margins.

She&#39;s also dead. But not just dead. Madison is in Hell. Chuck Palahniuk&#39;s latest, &#34;Damned&#34;, takes us on Madison&#39;s journey through Hell, as she navigates the Hillocks of Discarded Nail Pairings and the River of Vomit, meeting everyone from Charles Darwin to Marilyn Monroe, with a colorful cast of characters (damned for unspeakable acts, like wearing white shoes after Labor Day), to determine why she&#39;s really there, and whether she will be damned for eternity. In &#34;Damned&#34;, Hell really does exist, as a place where your only career choice is telemarketer (yes, that&#39;s where those calls actually originate), the currency is Halloween candy, and &#39;the in-flight movie is always &#34;The English Patient&#34;, never &#34;The Breakfast Club&#34;.&#39; With witty, laugh-out-loud prose, and a twist like only Palahniuk can write, this dark comedic novel is sure to be ranked among his best.</p><p>Chuck Palahniuk&#39;s eleven previous novels are the bestselling Tell-All, Pygmy, Snuff, Rant, Haunted, Lullaby, Diary, Choke - which has been made into a film by director Clark Gregg, starring Sam Rockwell and Anjelica Huston - Survivor, Invisible Monsters, and Fight Club, which was made into a film by director David Fincher. He is also the author of the nonfiction profile of Portland, Oregon, Fugitives and Refugees, and the nonfiction collection Stranger Than Fiction. He lives in the Pacific Northwest.I.<br><br>Are you there, Satan? It&#x2019;s me, Madison. I&#x2019;m just now arrived here, in Hell, but it&#x2019;s not my fault except for maybe dying from an overdose of marijuana. Maybe I&#x2019;m in Hell because I&#x2019;m fat--a Real Porker. If you can go to Hell for having low self-esteem, that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here. I wish I could lie and tell you I&#x2019;m bone-thin with blond hair and big ta-tas. But, trust me, I&#x2019;m fat for a really good reason.<br><br>To start with, please let me introduce myself.<br>How to best convey the exact sensation of being dead . . .<br><br>Yes, I know the word convey. I&#x2019;m dead, not a mental defective.<br><br>Trust me, the being-dead part is much easier than the dying part. If you can watch much television, then being dead will be a cinch. Actually, watching television and surfing the Internet are really excellent practice for being dead.<br><br>The closest way I can describe death is to compare it to when my mom boots up her notebook computer and hacks into the surveillance system of our house in Mazatlan or Banff. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say, turning the screen sideways for me to see, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s snowing.&#x201d; Glowing softly on the computer would be the interior of our Milan house, the sitting room, with snow falling outside the big windows, and by long distance, holding down her Control, Alt and W keys, my mom would draw open the sitting room drapes all the way. Pressing the Control and D keys, she&#x2019;d dim the lights by remote control and we&#x2019;d both sit, on a train or in a rented town car or aboard a leased jet, watching the pretty winter view through the windows of that empty house displayed on her computer screen. With the Control and F keys, she&#x2019;d light a fire in the gas fireplace, and we&#x2019;d listen to the hush of the Italian snow falling, the crackle of the flames via the audio monitors of the security system. After that, my mom would keyboard into the system for our house in Cape Town. Then log on to view our house in Brentwood. She could simultaneously be all places but no place, mooning over sunsets and foliage everywhere except where she actually was. At best, a sentry. At worst, a voyeur.<br><br>My mom will kill half a day on her notebook computer just looking at empty rooms full of our furniture. Tweaking the thermostat by remote control. Turning down the lights and choosing the right level of soft music to play in each room. &#x201c;Just to keep the cat burglars guessing,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d tell me. She&#x2019;d toggle from camera to camera, watching the Somali maid clean our house in Paris. Hunched over her computer screen, she&#x2019;d sigh and say, &#x201c;My crocus are blooming in London. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>From behind his open business section of the Times, my dad would say, &#x201c;The plural is crocuses.&#x201d;<br><br>Probably my mom would cackle then, hitting her Control and L keys to lock a maid inside a bathroom from three continents away because the tile didn&#x2019;t look adequately polished. To her this passed for way-wicked, good fun. It&#x2019;s affecting the environment without being physically present. Consumption in absentia. Like having a hit song you recorded decades ago still occupy the mind of a Chinese sweatshop worker you&#x2019;ll never meet. It&#x2019;s power, but a kind of pointless, impotent power.<br><br>On the computer screen a maid would place a vase filled with fresh-cut peonies on the windowsill of our house in Dubai, and my mom would spy by satellite, turning down the air-conditioning, colder and colder, with a tapping keystroke via her wireless connection, chilling that house, that one room, meat-locker cold, ski-slope cold, spending a king&#x2019;s ransom on Freon and electric power, trying to make some doomed ten bucks&#x2019; worth of pretty pink flowers last one more day.<br><br>That&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s like to be dead. Yes, I know the word absentia. I&#x2019;m thirteen years old, not stupid--and being dead, ye gods, do I comprehend the idea of absentia.<br><br>Being dead is the very essence of traveling light.<br><br>Being dead-dead means nonstop, twenty-four/seven, three hundred sixty-five days a year . . . forever.<br><br>How it feels when they pump out all of your blood, you don&#x2019;t want me to describe. Probably I shouldn&#x2019;t even tell you I&#x2019;m dead, because no doubt now you feel awfully superior. Even other fat people feel superior to Dead People. Nevertheless, here it is: my Hideous Admission. I&#x2019;ll fess up and come clean. I&#x2019;m out of the closet. I&#x2019;m dead. Now don&#x2019;t hold it against me.<br><br>Yes, we all look a little mysterious and absurd to each other, but no one looks as foreign as a dead person does. We can forgive some stranger her choice to practice Catholicism or engage in homosexual acts, but not her submission to death. We hate a backslider. Worse than alcoholism or heroin addiction, dying seems like the greatest weakness, and in a world where people say you&#x2019;re lazy for not shaving your legs, then being dead seems like the ultimate character flaw.<br><br>It&#x2019;s as if you&#x2019;ve shirked life--simply not made enough serious effort to live up to your full potential. You quitter! Being fat and dead--let me tell you--that&#x2019;s the double whammy.<br><br>No, it&#x2019;s not fair, but even if you feel sorry for me, you&#x2019;re probably also feeling pretty darn smug that you&#x2019;re alive and no doubt chewing on a mouthful of some poor animal that had the misfortune to live below you on the food chain. I&#x2019;m not telling you all of this to gain your sympathy. I&#x2019;m thirteen years old, and a girl, and I&#x2019;m dead. My name is Madison, and the last thing I need is your stupid condescending pity. No, it&#x2019;s not fair, but it&#x2019;s how people do. The first time we meet another person an insidious little voice in our head says, &#x201c;I might wear eyeglasses or be chunky around the hips or a girl, but at least I&#x2019;m not Gay or Black or a Jew.&#x201d; Meaning: I may be me--but at least I have the good sense not to be YOU. So I hesitate to even mention that I&#x2019;m dead because everyone already feels so darned superior to dead people, even Mexicans and AIDS people. It&#x2019;s like when learning about Alexander the Great in our seventh-grade Influences of Western History class, what keeps running through your head is: &#x201c;If Alexander was so brave and smart and . . . Great . . . why&#x2019;d he die?&#x201d;<br><br>Yes, I know the word insidious.<br><br>Death is the One Big Mistake that none of us EVER plans to make. That&#x2019;s why the bran muffins and the colonoscopies. It&#x2019;s how come you take vitamins and get Pap smears. No, not you--you&#x2019;re never going to die--so now you feel all superior to me. Well, go ahead and think that. Keep smearing your skin with sunblock and feeling yourself for lumps. Don&#x2019;t let me spoil the Big Surprise.<br><br>But, to be honest, when you&#x2019;re dead probably not even homeless people and retarded people will want to trade you places. I mean, worms get to eat you. It&#x2019;s like a complete violation of all your civil rights. Death ought to be illegal but you don&#x2019;t see Amnesty International starting any letter-writing campaigns. You don&#x2019;t see any rock stars banding together to release hit singles with all the proceeds going to solve MY getting my face chewed off by worms.<br><br>My mom would tell you I&#x2019;m too flip and glib about everything. My mom would say, &#x201c;Madison, please don&#x2019;t be such a smart aleck.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re dead; now just calm down.&#x201d;<br><br>Probably me being dead is a gigantic relief to my dad; this way, at least, he won&#x2019;t have to worry about me embarrassing him by getting pregnant. My dad used to say, &#x201c;Madison, whatever man ends up with you, he&#x2019;s going to have his hands full. . . .&#x201d; If my dad only knew.<br><br>When my goldfish, Mister Wiggles, died we flushed him down the toilet. When my kitten, Tiger Stripe, died I tried the same deal, and we had to call a plumber to snake the pipes. What a big mess. Poor Tiger Stripe. When I died, I won&#x2019;t go into the details, but let&#x2019;s say some Mr. Pervy McPervert mortician got to see me naked and pump out all my blood and commit God only knows what deranged carnal high jinks with my virginal thirteen-year-old body. You can call me glib, but death is about the biggest joke around. After all the permanent waves and ballet lessons my mom paid for, here I am getting a hot-spit tongue bath from some paunchy, depraved mortuary guy.<br><br>I can tell you, when you&#x2019;re dead, you pretty much have to give up your demands about boundaries and personal space. Just understand, I didn&#x2019;t die because I was too lazy to live. I didn&#x2019;t die because I wanted to punish my family. And no matter how much I slag my parents, don&#x2019;t get the idea that I hate them. Yes, for a while I hung around, watching my mom hunched over her notebook computer, tapping the keys Control, Alt, and L to lock the door of my bedroom in Rome, my room in Athens, all my rooms around the world. She keyboarded to close all my drapes after that, and turn down the air-conditioning and activate the electrostatic air filtration so not even dust would settle on my dolls and clothes and stuffed animals. It simply makes sense that I should miss my parents more than they miss me, especially when you consider that they only loved me for thirteen years while I loved them for my entire life. Forgive me for not sticking around longer, but I don&#x2019;t want to be dead and just watching everybody while I chill rooms, flicker the lights, and pull the drapes open and shut. I don&#x2019;t want to be simply a voyeur.<br><br>No, it&#x2019;s not fair, but what makes earth feel like Hell is our expectation that it should feel like Heaven. Earth is earth. Dead is dead. You&#x2019;ll find out for yourself soon enough. It won&#x2019;t help the situation for you to get all upset.<br>II.<br><br>Are you there, Satan? It&#x2019;s me, Madison. Please don&#x2019;t get the impression that I dislike Hell. No, really, it&#x2019;s way swell. Tons better than I expected. Honestly, it&#x2019;s obvious you&#x2019;ve worked very hard for a very long time on the roiling, surging oceans of scalding-hot barf, and the stinking sulfur smell, and the clouds of buzzing black flies.<br>If my version of Hell fails to impress you, please consider that to be my own shortcoming. I mean, what do I know? Probably any grown-up would pee herself silly, seeing the flying vampire bats and majestic, cascading waterfalls of smelly poop. No doubt the fault is entirely my own, because if I&#x2019;d ever imagined Hell it was as a fiery version of that classic Hollywood masterpiece The Breakfast Club, populated, let&#x2019;s remember, by a hypersocial, pretty cheerleader, a rebel stoner type, a dumb football jock, a brainy geek, and a misanthropic psycho, all locked together in their high school library doing detention on an otherwise ordinary Saturday except with every book and chair being blazing on fire.<br><br>Yes, you might be alive and Gay or Old or a Mexican, lording that over me, but consider that I&#x2019;ve had the actual experience of waking up on my first day in Hell, and you&#x2019;ll just have to take my word for what all this is like. No, it&#x2019;s not fair, but you can forget about the fabled tunnel of bright, spectral-white light and being greeted by the open arms of your long-deceased grandma and grandpa; maybe other people have reported that blissful process, but consider that those people are currently alive, or they remained living for sufficient time to report on their encounter. My point is: Those people enjoyed what&#x2019;s clearly labeled a &#x201c;near-death experience.&#x201d; I, on the other hand, am dead, with my blood long ago pumped out and worms munching on me. In my book that makes me the higher authority. Other people, like famous Italian poet Dante Alighieri, I&#x2019;m sorry to say, simply hoisted a generous helping of campy make-believe on the reading public.<br><br>Thus, disregard my account of Hell at your own peril.<br><br>First off, you wake up lying on the stone floor inside a fairly dismal cell composed of iron bars; and take my stern advice--don&#x2019;t touch anything. The prison cell bars are filthy dirty. If by accident you DO touch the bars, which look a tad slimy with mold and someone else&#x2019;s blood, do NOT touch your face--or your clothes--not if you have any aspiration to stay looking nice until Judgment Day.<br><br>And do NOT eat the candy you&#x2019;ll see scattered everywhere on the ground.<br><br>The exact means by which I arrived in the underworld remain a little unclear. I recall a chauffeur standing curbside somewhere, next to a parked black Lincoln Town Car, holding a white placard with my name written on it, MADISON SPENCER, in all-caps terrible handwriting. The chauffeur--those people never speak English--had on mirrored sunglasses and a visored chauffeur cap, so most of his face was hidden. I remember him opening the rear door so I could step inside; after that was a way-long drive with the windows tinted so dark I couldn&#x2019;t quite see out, but what I&#x2019;ve just described could&#x2019;ve been any one of ten bazillion rides I&#x2019;ve taken between airports and cities. Whether that Town Car delivered me to Hell, I can&#x2019;t swear, but the next thing is I woke up in this filthy cell.<br><br>Probably I woke up because someone was screaming; in Hell, someone is always screaming. Anyone who&#x2019;s ever flown London to Sydney, seated next to or anywhere in the proximity of a fussy baby, you&#x2019;ll no doubt fall right into the swing of things in Hell. What with the strangers and crowding and seemingly endless hours of waiting for nothing to happen, for you Hell will feel like one long, nostalgic hit of d�j� vu. Especially if your in-flight movie was The English Patient. In Hell, whenever the demons announce they&#x2019;re going to treat everyone to a big-name Hollywood movie, don&#x2019;t get too excited because it&#x2019;s always The English Patient or, unfortunately, The Piano. It&#x2019;s never The Breakfast Club.<br><br>In regard to the smell, Hell comes nowhere near as bad as Naples in the summertime during a garbage strike.<br><br>If you ask me, people in Hell just scream to hear their own voice and to pass the time. Still, complaining about Hell occurs to me as a tad bit obvious and self-indulgent. Like so many experiences you venture into knowing full well that they&#x2019;ll be terrible, in fact the core pleasure resides in their very innate badness, like eating Swanson frozen chicken potpies at boarding school or a Banquet frozen Salisbury steak on the cook&#x2019;s night out. Or eating really anything in Scotland. Allow me to venture that the sole reason we enjoy certain pastimes such as watching the film version of Valley of the Dolls arises from the comfort and familiarity of its very inherent poor quality.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Holt Algebra 1</h2><p>Scuffed edges.

Has been called a must read for every serious martial artist.</p><p>Dillman&#39;s theory will totally change the way future generations learn karateGeorge A. Dillman, a 9th degree black belt in Ryukyu Kempo Tomari-te, recently honored by Black Belt Magazine as &#x201c; 1997--Instructor of the Year&#x201d; is one of the U.S.A.&#x2019;s best known and well-established martial arts personalities. Dillman came to the attention of the martial arts press when he began competing in the early 1960&#x2019;s. By the end of that decade, he had started running his own tournament, called the Northeast Open Karate Championships. This competition was held annually-- the first kicking off in Palmer Park, Maryland in 1966. The site was moved to Suitland Maryland in 1967, and moved again to Reading, PA in 1968 where it was held until 1996. <p>Official Karate magazine (Nov.1982), described Dillman as, &#x201c;one of the winningest competitors karate has ever known.&#x201d; Dillman was four-times National Karate Champion (1969-1972) and during this period was consistently ranked among top ten competitors in the nation by major karate magazines. During his nine-year competitive career, Dillman claimed a total of 327 trophies in fighting, forms, breaking, and weapons. </p><p>Dillman began serious martial arts training in 1961 with Harry G. Smith. He went on to study with Daniel K. Pai, James Coffman, Sam Pearson, Robert Trias and Seiyu Oyata. Dillman has always considered himself a student, never a master of the martial arts. To this end he and his wife and students have traveled throughout the United States to meet and train with various martial arts experts. </p><p>Because of his perseverance, Dillman&#x2019;s martial arts talents have earned him widespread U.S. media coverage. He has appeared on 35 National TV shows, including: Real People, Mike Douglas, PM Magazine, Evening Magazine, and NBC&#x2019;s Sports Machine. Dillman has also been featured five times in Ripley&#x2019;s Believe It or Not, and has been the subject of over 300 newspaper and magazine articles. Dillman, who was a professional boxer for three and one half years, is the only person known to have trained with both Bruce Lee and Muhammad Ali. In May of 1988. Dillman was inducted into the Berks County Sports Hall of Fame. He was the first martial artist to be included. </p><p>Currently, Dillman travels the world teaching seminars on pressure points and tuite (grappling) hidden within the traditional movements of the old martial arts forms. It is his research and scientific dissection of the old forms that is earning him his most notoriety. Never one to shy away from controversy, Dillman has rediscovered a formerly secret level of meaning for kata movements, and has made that interpretation understandable to all. He has produced a video tape instructional series on the pressure points, and has written six books with Chris Thomas: Kyusho-Jitsu: The Dillman Method of Pressure Point Fighting; Advanced Pressure Point Fighting of Ryukyu Kempo; Advanced Pressure Point Grappling: Tuite; Pressure Point Karate Made Easy; Humane Pressure Point Self-Defense; and Little Jay Learns Karate. The books have been said to be,&#x201d; the definitive martial arts books of the century,&#x201d; and &#x201c;unparalleled among current martial arts literature.&#x201d; </p><p>Dillman is the chief instructor for Dillman Karate International, an organization of over 85 schools worldwide, with an enrollment of nearly 15,000 students. He has studied under five 10th degree black belts from Okinawa and is currently furthering his personal study through research, practice, and the sharing of techniques with Prof. Remy Presas ( Modern Arnis) and Prof. Wally Jay (Small Circle Jujitsu). </p><p>Chris Thomas has studied karate since 1970, and holds a black belt ranking in three separate styles: Shotokan, Isshinryu, and Ryukyu Kempo Tomari-te. Thomas is a widely published and respected authority on martial arts whose works have appeared in martial arts periodicals world-wide.</p></p><h2>The Marks of God&#39;s Children (Classics of Reformed Spirituality)</h2><p>Jean Taffin is often called the father of the Dutch Second Reformation.

Ethel Willis White Books xx)</h2><p>Seattle was a very different city in 1960 than it is today. There were no black bus drivers, sales clerks, or bank tellers. Black children rarely attended the same schools as white children. And few black people lived outside of the Central District. In 1960, Seattle was effectively a segregated town.<br><br>Energized by the national civil rights movement, an interracial group of Seattle residents joined together to form the Seattle chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). Operational from 1961 through 1968, CORE had a brief but powerful effect on Seattle. The chapter began by challenging one of the more blatant forms of discrimination in the city, local supermarkets. Located within the black community and dependent on black customers, these supermarkets refused to hire black employees. CORE took the supermarkets to task by organizing hundreds of volunteers into shifts of continuous picketers until stores desegregated their staffs. From this initial effort CORE, in partnership with the NAACP and other groups, launched campaigns to increase employment and housing opportunities for black Seattleites, and to address racial inequalities in Seattle public schools. The members of Seattle CORE were committed to transforming Seattle into a more integrated and just society.<br><br>Seattle was one of more than one hundred cities to support an active CORE chapter. <i>Seattle in Black and White</i> tells the local, Seattle story about this national movement. Authored by four active members of Seattle CORE, this book not only recounts the actions of Seattle CORE but, through their memories, also captures the emotion and intensity of this pivotal and highly charged time in America&#x2019;s history.<br><br>For more information visit: http://seattleinblackandwhite.org/</p><p><b>Joan Singler</b> was a founder of Seattle CORE and served as CORE secretary and chaired the Housing Committee.

Sonny Barger is the Hells Angel of all Hells Angels, the motorcycle club which has been the scourge of America for over forty years. Sonny was their de facto leader for much of that time, the man who Hunter S. Thompson immortalised in his 1965 classic Hells Angels, noting &#34;Barger is nothing short of Winston Churchill when it come to leading people.&#34; He&#39;s been called an American legend and he&#39;s feared and revered by people on both sides of the law. From the club&#39;s formation in the 1940s to the height of their notoriety twenty years later, from Sonny&#39;s first hand account of what really happened with the Rolling Stones at Altamont to his periods of imprisonment, from his fights with rival gangs and the police to his own battle with cancer, Hell&#39;s Angel sets the record straight. Sonny Barger has ridden with the Angels for forty years, obeying no law but that of the HAMC. For the first time, this is his own -- and their own -- story.</p><p>Ralph &#34;Sonny&#34; Barger rides his customized Harley Davidson FXRT sportster every day and bench presses 285 pounds.

Into these pages he pours nearly half a century of searching and finding answers to the Mexican experience in the southwestern United States. He describes and analyzes the process, as generation upon generation of Mexicans moved north and attempted to create an identity or sense of cultural space and place. In today&#x2019;s border fences he also sees barriers to how Mexicans understand themselves and how they are fundamentally understood. From prehistory to the present, V�lez-Ib��ez traces the intense bumping among Native Americans, Spaniards, and Mexicans, as Mesoamerican populations and ideas moved northward. He demonstrates how cultural glue is constantly replenished by strengthening family ties that reach across both sides of the border. The author describes ways in which Mexicans have resisted and accommodated the dominant culture by creating communities and by forming labor unions, voluntary associations, and cultural movements. He analyzes the distribution of sadness, or overrepresentation of Mexicans in poverty, crime, illness, and war, and shows how that sadness is balanced by creative expressions of literature and art, especially mural art, in the ongoing search for space and place. Here is a book for the nineties and beyond, a book that relates to NAFTA, to complex questions of immigration, and to the expanding population of Mexicans in the U.S.-Mexico border region and other parts of the country. An important new volume for social science, humanities, and Latin American scholars, <i>Border Visions</i> will also attract general readers for its robust narrative and autobiographical edge.

In <i>Know the Mother</i>, author Desiree Cooper explores the complex archetype of the mother in all of her incarnations. In a collage of meditative stories, women-both black and white-find themselves wedged between their own yearnings and their roles as daughters, sisters, grandmothers, and wives.</p><p>In this heart-wrenching collection, Cooper reveals that gender and race are often unanticipated interlopers in family life. An anxious mother reflects on her prenatal fantasies of suicide while waiting for her daughter to come home late one night. A lawyer miscarries during a conference call and must proceed as though nothing has happened. On a rare night out with her husband, a new mother tries convincing herself that everything is still the same. A politician's wife's thoughts turn to slavery as she contemplates her own escape: "Even Harriet Tubman had realized that freedom wasn't worth the price of abandoning her family, so she'd come back home. She'd risked it all for love." With her lyrical and carefully crafted prose, Cooper's stories provide truths without sermon and invite empathy without sentimentality.</p><p><i>Know the Mother</i> explores the intersection of race and gender in vignettes that pull you in and then are gone in an instant.

An imaginative architect and designer, he was deemed one of the originators of the supergraphics look of the 1960s, the high-tech aesthetic of the 1970s, and the loft look of the 1980s. This lavishly illustrated monograph collects -- for the first time ever -- over forty of his incredible projects.<br><br> Working in New York during the late 1960s and early 1970s, he became famous for his ad-hoc style. The postwar era's bold materials (vinyl, formica, plastic) were united with his flair for embellishing modern forms while mimicking popular culture's nuances -- a big curve here, a little wiggle there. A favorite among design professionals and magazine editors, his death in 1987 robbed the industry of a major talent.<br><br> Featured are his notorious loft spaces for his star clients, who collaborated with Buchsbaum on these dramatic transformations. His world of fantasy and luxury was also a place of function and comfort, as seen in his commercial spaces, retail stores, and hotels -- the 1986-87 Nevele Hotel renovation is a tour de force of retro-chic design. Also documented is a cornucopia of his furnishings, including rugs, tables, chairs, and slipcovers.

She&#39;s received the Henry Bergh Children&#39;s Book Award from the ASPCA for Excellence in Humane Literature for Young Readers; the Africana Honor Book Award, from the African Studies Association, honoring outstanding books about Africa for children and young adults; and has been included many times on The Notable Books for a Global Society list. She always writes about nature or cross-cultural topics. Cristina is an avid bird-watcher who has a personal list of birds from all seven continents. She&#39;s even hugged a penguin in Antarctica! In 2001, Cristina and her husband, Joe, moved from the Sahara in Mali to the sea on St. John, US Virgin Islands. To learn more about Cristina, visit her website: http://www.cristinakessler.comAges 5-8. When a Sudanese village installs a new water pump, young Fatima is the first to push the handle. In the past, the villagers coped with the long, dry seasons by storing water in the trunks of the ancient baobab trees. But with the new pump, nobody prepares their trees except Fatima's grandmother, who is skeptical about disregarding the "old ways." With Fatima's help, she fills her tree, and when the pump breaks during a drought, the villagers flock to the baobab, as grandmother says, "Maybe it's wise to mix old with new." Despite the heavy message, this is a lyrically told story with cultural particulars woven gracefully into the text. With creative perspectives and spare compositions, Krudop's oil illustrations ably extend the story's strong sense of character and place, showing the respect between Fatima and her grandmother and for the tree set against the stark landscape. Another intriguing African story from a longtime resident of the continent. Included are a helpful author's note and a glossary of the few Arabic words used in text. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A pedantic introduction regrettably sets a tone of stilted admiration for a succession of cliched Romantic country houses, further marred by poor photography and lackluster catalogues of interiors and the houses' ownership histories. In the main, the 20th century selections are the most compelling, enlivened by sophisticated, luminous photographs of such breathtaking images as a post-modern "farmhouse" in the "Pennsylvania vernacular" and a pink neo-Moorish Marbella resort. Gilliatt (The Complete Book of Home Design) describes with particular verve the dramatic architectural feat of Ricardo Bofill, who brilliantly transforms a series of abandoned cement silos in Barcelona into a modern Gothic marvel. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Reader (S.P.I.R.E.

These essays together give the inner shape of a life, up to the age of fifty-five, of a relatively fortunate American male. He has attempted, his foreword states, &#x201c;to treat this life, this massive datum which happens to be mine, as a specimen life, representative in its odd uniqueness of all the oddly unique lives in this world.&#x201d; In the service of this metaphysical effort, he has been hair-raisingly honest and beautifully eloquent, not to say, in a number of places, self-effacingly funny. He takes the reader beyond self-consciousness, into sheer wonder at the world and its fabric.</p><p>Self-Consciousness <br> <br>One of our finest novelists now gives us his most dazzling creation -- his own life. In six eloquent and compelling chapters, the author of The Witches of Eastwick and the wonderful Rabbit trilogy gives us an incitingly honest look at the makings of an American writer -- and of an American man. <br> <br>Here is Updike on his childhood, on ailments both horrible (psoriasis) and hilarious (his experiences at the hands of a dentist), on his stuttering, on his feelings during the Vietnam War, on his genealogy. and on that most elusive of subjects, his innermost self.

Now, in an astonishing blend of art and science, he unveils his revolutionary theory of &#39;Six Songs&#39;, and describes how music played a pivotal role in the creation of human culture and society. Dividing the sum total of human musical achievement, from Beethoven to The Beatles, Busta Rhymes to Bach, into just six fundamental forms, Levitin illuminates, through songs of friendship, joy, comfort, knowledge, religion and love, how music has been instrumental in the evolution of language, thought and culture. And how, far from being a bit of a song and dance, music is at the core of what it means to be human. A one-time record producer, now a leading neuroscientist, Levitin has composed a catchy and startlingly ambitious narrative that weaves together Darwin and Dionne Warwick, memoir and biology, anthropology and a jukebox of anecdote to create nothing less than the &#39;soundtrack of civilisation&#39;. The World in Six Songs will change the way you listen to music for ever. Daniel Levitin is the James McGill Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at McGill University. Before entering academia he worked as a session musician, sound engineer and record producer. He lives in Montreal, Canada.&#x201c;Music seems to have an almost willful, evasive quality, defying simple explanation, so that the more we find out, the more there is to know, leaving its power and mystery intact, however much we may dig and delve. Daniel&#x2019;s book is an eloquent and poetic exploration of this paradox. There may be no simple answer or end in sight, but the ride is nonetheless a thrilling one, especially in the company of a writer who is an accomplished musician, a poet, a hard-nosed scientist, and someone who can still look upon the universe with a sense of wonder.&#x201d;<br> --<b>Sting</b><br><br> &#x201c;Without music, we would be little more than animals, and Daniel Levitin explains it beautifully.&#x201d;<br> --<b>Sir George Martin</b>, CBE, producer of The Beatles<br><br> &#x201c;Why can a song make you cry in a matter of seconds? <i>Six Songs</i> is the only book that explains why. With original and awe-inspiring insights into the nature of human artistry, it&#x2019;s irresistibly entertaining. Anyone who loves music should read it.&#x201d;<br> --<b>Bobby McFerrin</b>, vocalist and guest conductor, London Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic<br><br> &#x201c;Daniel Levitin takes the most sophisticated ideas that exist about the brain and mind, applies them to the most emotionally direct art we have, our songs, and makes beautiful music of the two together.&#x201d;<br> --<b>Adam Gopnik</b>, author of <i>Paris to the Moon</i><br><br> &#x201c;Daniel Levitin writes about music with all the exuberance of a die-hard fan, and all the insight of a natural-born scientist. This is a fascinating, entertaining book, and some of its most inventive themes may stay stick in your head forever, something like a well-loved song.&#x201d;<br> --<b>Elizabeth Gilbert</b>, author of <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i><br><br> &#x201c;To try to cover the meaning of music throughout the history of mankind to how we still use it everyday is extraordinarily ambitious. Combining musical expertise, psychology, anthropology and evolutionary science, Daniel Levitin&#x2019;s <i>Six Songs</i> has accomplished this astonishing task.&#x201d;<br> --Jon Appleton, Composer and Professor of Music, Dartmouth College and Stanford University<br><br> &#x201c;I was skeptical when I began reading. The stated goal seemed outlandish. But by the time I was about one-third the way into <i>The World in Six Songs</i>, I realized just how powerful it is. It really is a tour de force. It is exquisitely written, and brings together a vast array of knowledge, tying things together in creative ways, while always remaining accessible. This promises to be not only another widely read hit, but also an important document for the field of music cognition.&#x201d;<br> --Jamshed Bharucha, Provost and Professor of Psychology, Tufts University<br><br> &#x201c;Passionate and insightful. Daniel Levitin has written a delightfully personal epic poem proposing a central role for music in the evolution of human emotion and behavior. Now, musicians and neuroscientists have a common vocabulary with which to argue our human origins.&#x201d;<br> --Julie R. Korenberg, M.D. Ph.D., The Brain Institute, University of Utah<br><br> &#x201c;In a brilliantly novel approach to human evolution, Levitin has sought to encapsulate diverse cultures in a set of six songs representative of friendship, joy, comfort, knowledge, religion and love. That he is able to achieve so much with this small set of songs says something truly important about our common humanity.&#x201d;<br> --Michael I. Posner, Professor of Psychology, University of Oregon<br><br> &#x201c;This wonderful, lucid book takes on one of the great eternal questions: Why is there music? What does music do for humanity&#x2014;for individual development and for a culture--that in turn accounts for its existence in every known society? Daniel Levitin is not only the preeminent expert in answering such questions, but one of those unique writers about science who understands his field so profoundly that he can make the complex straightforward. This is an exciting, revelatory book.&#x201d;<br> --Scott Turow, author of <i>Presumed Innocent</i> and <i>Ordinary Heroes</i></p><h2>Repentance: Cleansing Your Generational Bloodline</h2><p>Jesus Christ bought us with His blood and we no longer belong to ourselves. He paid the price at Calvary for us to come into the fullness of our destiny, but it remains our responsibility to deliver ourselves to God. We must choose to repent and break all of the agreements / contracts/ covenants that we have entered into through personal sin or inherited from our forefathers. This process of cleansing our bloodlines is a long one that requires diligence and perseverance. He has already done it at the cross, but we must work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Natasha Grbich draws on more than 20 years of experience in bloodline deliverance prayer to give us guidelines to do this. This is not just a book to read, but rather a manual to work and pray through.

Only months later, Thaddeus drops dead of a heart attack, and Bill is left to pick up the pieces of his chaotic and poorly managed practice. Before he can even start to make sense of the mess that was Thaddeus's legal life, the police are knocking at his door, and Bill is being accused of fencing stolen treasure. Enter Abby Birdsong and Grady Jackson, two clients of Thaddeus's whose files are among the boxes and papers and bourbon bottles that litter his office. Drug charges had been brought against Abby for carrying two pounds of pot in her bag; and Grady seeks a permit from the state of Oregon to dig for treasure on a local beach. Bill takes on both of their cases, which, on the face of it, aren't related. When the two cases collide in ways that seem too fantastic to be true, Bill finds himself caught in the middle. </p><p>How Thaddeus and Bill, Abby and Grady, assorted law enforcement officials and colorful hangers-on overlap and interconnect took Bill another nineteen years to puzzle out. The result is an intricate and original legal yarn with a cast of provincial misfits so peculiar and charming it reads like fiction.</p></p><p><p><b>Bill Merritt</b> practiced law in Portland, Oregon, for more than a decade, and lives there still. He's the author of <i>Where the Rivers Ran Backward</i>, about his experience in Vietnam.</p>*Starred Review* Six months after Merritt joined the law practice of the delightfully corrupt (and memorably named) Thaddeus Silk, Silk died of a heart attack. It might have been a promising development for Merritt--just months out of law school, he'd inherited an entire firm--except Silk's office was soon under investigation from both the Oregon Bar Association and the cops. Merritt was quickly implicated in Silk's shenanigans, and things got worse when he took the case of a dope smoker named Abby Birdsong. Birdsong rented a storage locker containing somewhere between one and four <i>tons </i>of marijuana--all of which was for her own personal use, naturally. Merritt's other major client was completely insane, digging for sunken Spanish treasure on the Oregon coast--treasure that he may have found and then fenced through Silk. This is at once a fascinating portrait of Oregon and a rollicking, frequently hilarious true-crime caper, and Merritt's forthright and funny self-deprecation makes it the rarest sort of story: the kind where you root for the lawyer. And with its world-class cast of eccentrics, Merritt's Oregon makes Carl Hiaasen's Florida look mundane. <i>John Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She would probably have been slightly prouder if she'd managed to make Corporal, but she took what she could get.<br><br>What she could get, on the other hand, could be a bit disconcerting on some days. She approached the guards at the door&#x2014;today Tanner and Gillas were at their posts&#x2014;and stopped before she'd passed between them. They were giving her funny looks, and she was on time. She'd been on time for four days running, although one emergency with the midwives' guild had pulled her off active duty in the middle of the day, but the looks on their faces didn't indicate a lost betting pool.<br><br>"What's up?" she asked Tanner. She had to look up to ask it; he was easily over six feet in height, and he didn't slouch when on duty.<br><br>"You'll find out," he replied. He was almost smirking.<br><br>The problem with coming to the Hawks as an angry thirteen-year-old with a lot of attitude was that the entire force felt as if they'd watched you grow up. This meant the entire damn force took an interest in your personal business. She cursed Tanner under her breath, and left his chuckle at her back.<br><br>It was only about ten feet from her back when she ran into Corporal Severn Handred. Who just happened to be loitering in the Aerie, under the shadows of the flying Aerians, who were practicing maneuvers that no other race on the force could achieve without a hell of a lot of magic, most of which would require postmaneuver paperwork that would keep them grounded for weeks. The Emperor was not a big fan of magic that wasn't under his personal control.<br><br>Kaylin, her wrist weighted by a few pounds of what was ostensibly gold, knew this firsthand. The bracer&#x2014;studded with what were also ostensibly gemstones, and in and of itself more valuable than most of the force on a good day, which would be a day when their Sergeant wasn't actively cursing the amount of money being wasted employing their sorry butts&#x2014;was also magical. It was older than the Empire.<br><br>No one knew how it worked&#x2014;or at least that's what was claimed&#x2014;but it kept random magic neutralized. Kaylin had been ordered to wear it, and on most days, she did.<br><br>Severn looked up as she approached him. "You're on time," he said, falling into an easy step beside her.<br><br>"And the world hasn't ended," she replied. "Betting? It's four days running." It was a betting pool she'd been excluded from joining.<br><br>He grinned, but didn't answer, which meant yes, he was betting, and no, he hadn't lost yet.<br><br>"If you win, you can buy me lunch."<br><br>He raised a brow. "You're scrounging for lunch this early in the month?"<br><br>"Don't ask."<br><br>He laughed.<br><br>"Instead," she continued, "tell me why you're here."<br><br>"I work here."<br><br>"Ha, ha. You don't usually loiter in the Aerie, waiting for me to walk by." In fact, if it was something that was a matter of life or death, or at least keeping her job, he was more proactive: he'd show up at her apartment and throw her out of bed.<br><br>"Loitering and waiting are not considered&#x2014;"<br><br>"Tanner was smirking."<br><br>Severn winced. "An official courier came by the office this morning."<br><br>"Official courier?"<br><br>"An Imperial Courier."<br><br>"Please tell me it had nothing to do with me," she said, without much hope.<br><br>"You want me to lie?"<br><br>She snorted. "Is Marcus in a mood?"<br><br>"Let's just say he didn't seem overly surprised." Which wasn't much of an answer if the one you wanted was No.<br><br>Teela was in the office and at her desk, which was generally a bad sign. She was also on break, which meant she was lounging on a chair that was balanced on its back two legs, and watching the door. Tain was somewhere else, which meant Kaylin only had to deal with one of the Barrani Hawks she sometimes counted as friends. On this particular morning, she couldn't remember why, exactly.<br><br>The fact that Teela rose&#x2014;gracefully, because it was impossible for a Barrani not to be graceful&#x2014;the minute she laid emerald eyes on Kaylin made it clear who she'd been watching for. The fact that she was smiling as she sauntered across the usual chaos of the office meant she was amused. This didn't mean that the news for Kaylin was good, on the other hand.<br><br>"Good morning, Private Neya," the window said. "It is a bright and sunny day, but rain is expected in the late afternoon. Please dress accordingly while you are on duty."<br><br>Teela took one look at Kaylin's raised brows and laughed out loud.<br><br>Kaylin said a few choice words in Leontine.<br><br>"Please be aware that this is a multiracial office, and the terms that you are using might give offense to some of your cowork-ers," the same window chided.<br><br>Kaylin's jaw nearly hit the floor.<br><br>"Apparently," Teela said, as her laugh trailed off into a chuckle, "the mage that designed the window to be a cheerful, talking timepiece, was not entirely precise in his use of magic."<br><br>"Which means?"<br><br>"Off the record? Someone tampered with Official Office equipment."<br><br>"This is worse. The old window didn't greet us by name. What the hells were they trying to do?"<br><br>"Get it to shut up without actually breaking it."<br><br>"Which seems to be almost impossible. The breaking-it part."<br><br>"So does the shutting-it-up part, if it comes to that." Teela grinned. "We've started a new betting pool."<br><br>"Hell with the pool&#x2014;we should just make the Hawklord stay in this damn office. The window would be gone in less than a week." She started to head toward her very small desk.<br><br>"Private Neya," the window said, "you have not checked today's duty roster. Please check the roster to ascertain your current rounds."<br><br>Teela burst out laughing because Kaylin's facial expression could have soured new milk. She did, however, head toward the roster because she couldn't actually break the window, and she was pretty damn certain it would nag her until she checked.<br><br>Elani street had been penciled, in more or less legible writing, beside Kaylin's name. Severn was her partner. There were no investigations in progress that required her presence, although there were two ongoing. The shift started in half an hour. She took note of it as obviously as possible, and then returned to her desk, by way of Caitlin.<br><br>"Good morning, dear," Caitlin said, looking up from a small and tidy pile of papers.<br><br>Kaylin nodded, and then bent slightly over the desk. "What happened to the window?"<br><br>The older woman frowned slightly. "We're not officially certain, dear." Which meant she wouldn't say. "Sergeant Kassan is aware that the enchantment on the window is causing some difficulty. I believe he is scheduled to speak with the Hawklord."<br><br>"Thank the gods," Kaylin replied. The window, during this discussion, was in the process of greeting yet another coworker. "Does it do this all day?"<br><br>Caitlin nodded. "You weren't here yesterday," she added. Her frown deepened. "It not only greeted the employees by name, it also felt the need to greet every person who walked into&#x2014;or through&#x2014;the office in the same way."<br><br>"But&#x2014;"<br><br>Caitlin shrugged. "It's magic," she finally said, as if that explained everything. Given how Kaylin generally felt about magic, it probably did.<br><br>She tried to decide whether or not to ask about the Imperial Courier. Caitlin was the best source of information in the office, but if she felt it wasn't important or relevant to the questioner, she gave away exactly nothing. Since she was bound to find out sooner or later&#x2014;and probably sooner&#x2014;she held her tongue.<br><br>"Private Neya!" The low, deep rumble of Leontine growl momentarily stilled most of the voices in the office. Marcus, as she'd guessed, was not in the best of moods. "Caitlin <em>has </em>work to do, even if you don't."<br><br>"Sir!" Kaylin replied.<br><br>"He's in the office more than anyone else who works here," Caitlin whispered, by way of explanation. "And I believe the window likes to have a chat when things are quiet."<br><br>Kaylin grimaced in very real sympathy for Old Ironjaw.<br><br>"In particular, I think it's been trying to give him advice."<br><br>Which meant it wasn't going to last the week. Thank the gods.<br><br>"Oh, and, dear?" Caitlin added, as Kaylin began to move away from her desk, under the watchful glare of her Sergeant.<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"This is for you." She held out a small sheaf of paper.<br><br>Kaylin, who had learned to be allergic to paperwork from a master&#x2014;that being Marcus himself&#x2014;cringed reflexively as she held out a hand. "Am I going to like this?"<br><br>"Probably not," Caitlin said with very real sympathy. "I'm afraid it isn't optional."<br><br>Kaylin looked through the papers in her hands. "This is a class schedule."<br><br>"Yes, dear."<br><br>"But&#x2014;Mallory's gone&#x2014;"<br><br>"It's not about his request that you take&#x2014;and pass&#x2014;all of the courses you previously failed, if that's helpful. The Hawklord vetoed that, although I'm sorry to say Mallory's suggestion did meet with some departmental approval."<br><br>It was marginally helpful. "What's it about, then?"<br><br>Caitlin winced. "Etiquette lessons. And I believe that Lord Sanabalis has, of course, requested that your magical education resume."<br><br>"Is there any good news?"<br><br>"As far as we know, nothing is threatening to destroy either the City or the World, dear."<br><br>Kaylin stared glumly at the missive in her hands. "This is your subtle way of telling me not to start doing either, isn't it?"<br><br>Caitlin smiled. "They're just lessons. It's not the end of the World."<br><br>"So," Severn said, when she joined him and they began to head down the hall, "did you speak with Caitlin?"<br><br>"Yes. Let me guess. The entire office already knows the contents of these papers."<br><br>"Betting?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>He laughed. "Most of the office. How bad is it?"<br><br>"Two days a week with Sanabalis."<br><br>He raised a brow.<br><br>"With <em>Lord </em>Sanabalis."<br><br>"Better. Isn't that the same schedule you were on before the situation in the fiefs? You both survived that."<br><br>"Mostly. I think he broke a few chairs."<br><br>"He'd have to." Severn grinned. "Gods couldn't break that table."<br><br>It was true. The table in the West Room&#x2014;which had been given a much more respectful name before Marcus's time, which meant Kaylin had no idea what it was&#x2014;was harder than most sword steel. "Three <em>nights </em>of off-duty time with the etiquette teacher."<br><br>"Nights?"<br><br>She nodded grimly.<br><br>"Is the teacher someone the Hawks can afford to piss off?"<br><br>"I hope so."<br><br>"Who's teaching?"<br><br>"I don't know. It doesn't actually say."<br><br>"Where?"<br><br>She grimaced. "The Imperial Palace."<br><br>He winced in genuine sympathy. "I'm surprised Lord Gram-mayre approved this."<br><br>Kaylin was not known for her love of high society. The Hawklord was not known for his desire to have Kaylin and high society anywhere in the same room. Or city block. Which meant the dictate had come from someone superior to the Hawklord.<br><br>"It's not optional," Kaylin said glumly. "And the worst part is, if I pass, I probably get to do something big. Like meet the Emperor."<br><br>"I'd like to be able to say that won't kill you."<br><br>"You couldn't, with a straight face."<br><br>He shrugged. "When do you start?"<br><br>"Two days. I meet Sanabalis&#x2014;<em>Lord </em>Sanabalis&#x2014;for Magical Studies&#x2014;"<br><br>"Magical Studies? Does it actually say that?"<br><br>"Those are the exact words. Don't look at me, I didn't write it&#x2014;in the afternoon tomorrow." She dropped the schedule into her locker with as much care as she generally dropped dirty towels.<br><br>Elani street was not a hub of activity in the morning. It wasn't exactly deserted, but it was quiet, and the usual consumers of love potions and extracts to combat baldness, impotence, and unwanted weight were lingering on the other side of storefronts. Remembering her mood the last time she'd walked this beat, Kaylin took care not to knock over offending sandwich boards. On the other hand, she also took the same care not to read them.<br><br>"Kaylin?"<br><br>"Hmm?" She was looking at the cross section of charms in a small case in one window&#x2014;Mortimer's Magnificent Magic&#x2014;and glanced at her partner's reflection in the glass.<br><br>"You're rubbing your arms."<br><br>She looked down and realized he was right. "They're sort of itchy," she said.<br><br>He raised one brow. "Sort of itchy?"<br><br>The marks that adorned most of the insides of her arms were, like the ones that covered her inner thighs and half of her back, weather vanes for magic. Kaylin hesitated. "It doesn't feel the way it normally does when there's strong magic. It's&#x2014;they're just sort of itchy."<br><br>"And they've never been like that before."<br><br>She frowned. She'd had fleas once, while cat-sitting for an elderly neighbor. The itch wasn't quite the same, but it was similar.<br><br>She started to tell him as much, and was interrupted midsen-tence by someone screaming.<br><br>It was, as screams went, a joyful, ecstatic sound, which meant their hands fell to their clubs without drawing them. But they&#x2014;like every other busybody suddenly crowding the streets&#x2014;turned at the sound of the voice. It was distinctly male, and probably a lot higher than it normally was. Bouncing a glance between each other, they shrugged and headed toward the noise.<br><br>The scream slowly gathered enough coherence to form words, and the words, to Kaylin's surprise, had something to do with hair. And having hair. When they reached the small wagon set up on the street&#x2014;and Kaylin made a small note to check for permits, as that was one of the Dragon Emperor's innovations on tax collection&#x2014;the crowds had formed a thin wall.<br><br>The people who lived above the various shops in Elani street had learned, with time and experience, to be enormously cynical. Exposure to every promise of love, hair, or sexual prowess known to man&#x2014;or woman, for that matter&#x2014;tended to have that effect, as did the more esoteric promise to tease out the truth about the future and your destined greatness in it. They had pretty much heard&#x2014;and seen&#x2014;it all.<br><br>And given the charlatans who masqueraded as merchants on much of the street, both the permanent residents and the officers of the Law who patrolled it knew that it wasn't beyond them to hire an actor to suddenly be miraculously cured of baldness, impotence, or blindness.<br><br>Kaylin assumed that the man who was almost crying in joy was one of these actors. But if he was, he was damn good. She started to ask him his name, stopped as he almost hugged her, and then turned to glance at the merchant whose wagon this technically was.<br><br>He looked... slack-jawed and surprised. He didn't even bother to school his expression, which clearly meant he was new to this. Not new to fleecing people, she thought sourly, just new to success. When he took a look at the Hawk that sat dead center on her tabard, he straightened up, and the slack lines of his face tightened into something that might have looked like a grin&#x2014;on a corpse.<br><br></p><h2>The Art of War</h2><p>the book The Art of War</p><p></p><h2>Cordelia Harvey: Civil War Angel (Badger Biographies Series)</h2><p><i>Cordelia Harvey: Civil War Angel</i> tells the story of an iconic figure from Wisconsin&#x2019;s Civil War history. As the wife of a promising young governor, Cordelia Harvey seemed destined for great things. Then tragedy struck: her husband, Louis Harvey, drowned, and Cordelia found herself widowed and alone. Like Louis had, Cordelia cared deeply about the Wisconsin soldiers fighting in the Civil War, and she jumped at a job offer from the new governor: working as the sanitary agent for Wisconsin. In this position, Cordelia could fight for the well-being of the state&#x2019;s men and boys wounded in battle.&nbsp;Young readers will follow Cordelia on her travels up and down the Mississippi to visit Wisconsin soldiers in military hospitals. In her efforts to make sure soldiers were well cared for, Cordelia wrote to the governor about their need for wholesome food, clean supplies, and fresh air. Eventually, she would travel to Washington to plead with President Lincoln for a Soldier&#x2019;s Home hospital in Wisconsin. When Cordelia returned home after the war, she continued her humanitarian work by starting an orphanage for the children of fallen Civil War soldiers.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Cordelia Harvey: Civil War Angel</i> includes sidebars on medical care, early nursing, and military prisons.

He has been in the United States since 1991 and has taught widely in Europe and America."This book gives detailed instruction for dream yoga, including foundational practices done during the day. In the Tibetan tradition, the ability to dream lucidly is not an end in itself&#x2014;rather it provides an additional context in which one can engage in advanced and effective practices to achieve liberation. Dream yoga is followed by sleep yoga, also known as the yoga of clear light. It is a more advanced practice similar to the most secret Tibetan practices. The goal is to remain awake during deep sleep when the gross conceptual mind and the operation of the senses cease. Most Westerners do not even consider this depth of awareness a possibility, yet it is well-known in Tibetan Buddhist and Bon spiritual traditions.The result of these practices is greater happiness and freedom in both our waking and dreaming states. <i>The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep</i> imparts powerful methods for progressing along the path to liberation.

Ehrmann&nbsp;"Reinhard Bendix has written a major comparative account of the history of five countries, seeking to determine which factors made possible the rise of royal authority in the early period of their development and which factors accounted for the emergence more recently of political practices and institutions legitimized by the will of the people . . . . The author has conducted his inquiry with skill, intelligence, and vast learning. Here and there the reader will hear echoes and overtones of Arnold Toynbee and William H. McNeill, less in the conclusions that are reached than in the questions asked and the techniques employed. This is comparative history in the grand tradition, bold, challenging, scholarly, and ingenious. . . . The book rests on a solid mastery of the historical &nbsp;literature, analyzed and interpreted by a sharp mind ... . I remain impressed by the bold purposes and sharp insights of the book. It offers an analysis of the process of political modernization that is original, perceptive, and generally convincing."--Theodore S. Hamerow, <i>American Historical Review</i>&nbsp;"This is an important book . . . intended to make the point that the modernization of today's great nations followed unique courses,' in which each stage influenced but didn't determine the succeeding stage, and in which creativity, imitation, and diffusion are important factors . ... This affirmation of the unique is a useful corrective to the oversimplified model building which has characterized recent work in the field of development and modernization . . . . Surely Kings or People will quickly take its place in courses in comparative politics, political development, and political sociology . . . A teacher will treat this book as a treasure-house of examples and illustration; the general reader will find this a lucidly written introduction to world political history."--Gabriel A. Almond, <i>California Monthly</i>&nbsp;"Kings or People is equal to the grandeur of its subject: the political origins of the modern world. With Barrington Moore's <i>Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy</i> and Immanuel Wallerstein's <i>The Modern World System</i> which it matches in boldness, while &nbsp;differing radically in perspective, it is one of the truly powerful ventures in comparative historical sociology to have appeared in recent years."--Clifford Geertz&nbsp;"Reinhard Bendix has combined the particular approach with the general one, by studying the history of five separate countries and by demonstrating how the experience of each represented a critical stage in the general transformation of authority which, in turn, influenced the process of change in others . . . . A remarkable achievement on all counts."--Gordon A. Craig, Stanford University&nbsp;"No one seriously interested in political development in any nation in the world can afford to neglect this tremendous scholarly achievement or fail to come to grips with the ideas it contains. Kings or People will continue to be read after most of the contemporary literature on comparative politics is long and deservedly forgotten."--Victor Ferkiss, <i>Perspective</i>&#34;It is difficult to decide which is the more impressive: the authority and control with which Mr. Bendix writes of the traditions, the institutions, and the technological and social developments of cultures as diverse as the British, French, German, Russian, and Japanese, or the skill with which he weaves his separate stories into a persuasive scenario of the modern revolution.

Martin Interviews Bernard Cornwell </strong><br><strong> </strong> <strong> <br>George R.R. Martin sold his first story in 1971 and has been writing professionally since then. He spent ten years in Hollywood as a writer-producer, working on The Twilight Zone, Beauty and the Beast, and various feature films and television pilots that were never made. In the mid '90s he returned to prose, his first love, and began work on his epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire. He has been in the Seven Kingdoms ever since.</strong> <p><strong>George R.R. Martin:</strong> It has long been my contention that the historical novel and the epic fantasy are sisters under the skin, that the two genres have much in common. My series owes a lot to the work of J.R.R. Tolkien and the other great fantasists who came before me, but I've also read and enjoyed the work of historical novelists. Who were your own influences? Was historical fiction always your great passion? Did you ever read fantasy?</p> <p><strong>Bernard Cornwell:</strong> You're right--fantasy and historical novels are twins--and I've never been fond of the label 'fantasy' which is too broad a brush and has a fey quality. It seems to me you write historical novels in an invented world which is grounded in historical reality (if the books are set in the future then 'fantasy' magically becomes sci-fi). So I've been influenced by all three: fantasy, sci-fi and historical novels, though the largest influence has to be C.S. Forester's Hornblower books.</p> <p><strong>Martin:</strong> A familiar theme in a lot of epic fantasy is the conflict between good and evil. The villains are often Dark Lords of various ilks, with demonic henchmen and hordes of twisted, malformed underlings clad in black. The heroes are noble, brave, chaste, and very fair to look upon. Yes, Tolkien made something grand and glorious from that, but in the hands of lesser writers, well ... let's just say that sort of fantasy has lost its interest for me. It is the grey characters who interest me the most. Those are the sort I prefer to write about... and read about. It seems to me that you share that affinity. What is it about flawed characters that makes them more interesting than conventional heroes?</p> <p><strong>Cornwell:</strong> Maybe all our heroes are reflections of ourselves? I'm not claiming to be Richard Sharpe (God forbid), but I'm sure parts of my personality leaked into him (he's very grumpy in the morning). And perhaps flawed characters are more interesting because they are forced to make a choice... a conventionally good character will always do the moral, right thing. Boring. Sharpe often does the right thing, but usually for the wrong reasons, and that's much more interesting!</p> <p><strong>Martin:</strong> When Tolkien began writing <em>The Lord of the Rings, </em>it was intended as a sequel to <em><em>The Hobbit. "</em></em>The tale grew in the telling," he said later, when LOTR had grown into the trilogy we know today. That's a line I have often had occasion to quote over the years, as my own<em><em> <em>Song of Ice and Fire s</em></em></em>welled from the three books I had originally sold to the seven books (five published, two more to write) I'm now producing. Much of your own work has taken the form of multi-part series. Are your tales too 'growing in the telling,' or do you know how long your journeys will take before you set out? Did you know how many books Uhtred's story would require, when you first sat down to write about him?</p> <p><strong>Cornwell:</strong> No idea! I don't even know what will happen in the next chapter, let alone the next book, and have no idea how many books there might be in a series. E.L. Doctorow said something I like which is that writing a novel is a bit like driving down an unfamiliar country road at night and you can only see as far ahead as your somewhat feeble headlamps show. I write into the darkness. I guess the joy of reading a book is to find out what happens, and for me that's the joy of writing one too!</p><p>The sixth installment of Bernard Cornwell&#x2019;s bestselling series chronicling the epic saga of the making of England, &#x201c;like Game of Thrones, but real&#x201d; (<em>The Observer</em>, London)&#x2014;the basis for&nbsp;<em>The Last Kingdom</em>, the hit BBC America television series.</p><p>As the ninth century wanes, England is perched once more on the brink of chaos.

Selected by the author herself, the one hundred poems include thirty-seven previously uncollected pieces and the entire contents of three hard-to-find volumes: the award-winning <i>For My People</i> (1942), <i>Prophets for a New Day</i> (1970), and <i>October Journey</i> (1975).</p></p><p>Margaret Walker (1915-1998) wrote poetry, essays, the novel <i>Jubilee</i>, and a biography of Richard Wright.

She assumes the role of spokesperson and in the service of that role employs a multitude of techniques and inspirations: folklore, scriptural rhythms, ballad meter, sonnet forms, the Egyptian deities, political rhetoric.

The Sun</p><h2>The Iguana (English Edition) (English and Italian Edition)</h2><p>In this magical novel a Milanese count stumbles upon a desolate community of lost noblemen on an uncharted island off the coast of Portugal. When he discovers, to his utter amazement, that their ill-treated servant is in fact a maiden iguana, and then proceeds to fall in love with her, the story of Aleardo, Estralitta and don Ilario becomes universal -- the fantastic merges with the commonplace until a resonant reality emerges with subtle distillation. From first page to last, the reader is given a tale of tragic love and delusion that ranks among the most affecting in contemporary literature. The Iguana has the force of &#34;The Tempest,&#34; and is written with a grace comparable in every way to the works of Izak Dinesen and Djuna Barnes. Little wonder, then, that this novel was called by the noted critic Pietro Citati, &#34;one of the very few books destined to redeem the honor of Italian literature since the Second World War.&#34; First published in Italian in 1965, where it was awarded the Fiuggi Prize, this masterpiece is by one of the original Italian &#34;magic realists.&#34;</p><p>Anna Maria Ortese was born in Rome on June 13, 1914, one of seven children, and grew up in southern Italy and in Tripoli. Her formal education ended at age thirteen. Her first book, Angelici dolori, was issued in 1937. In 1953 her third collection, Il mare non bagna Napoli, won the coveted Viareggio prize; thereafter, Ortese's stories, novels, and journalism received many of the most distinguished Italian literary awards, including the Strega and the Fiuggi. Although she lived for many years in Naples following the Second World War, she also resided in Milan, in Rome, and for most of the last twenty years of her life in Rapallo. In addition to The Iguana, McPherson &amp; Co. has published two volumes of of her stories under the collective title, A Music Behind the Wall, also translated by Henry Martin.

But now, in this revelatory study, award-winning historian Leonard L. Richards makes clear the links between the Gold Rush and many of the regional crises in the lead-up to the Civil War.<br><br>Richards explains how Southerners envisioned California as a new market for slaves and saw themselves importing their own slaves to dig for gold, only to be frustrated by California&#x2019;s passage of a state constitution that prohibited slavery. Still, they schemed to tie California to the South with a southern-routed transcontinental railroad and worked to split off the southern half as a separate slave state. We see how the Gold Rush influenced the squabbling over the Gadsden Purchase, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and various attempts to take Cuba and Nicaragua. We meet David Broderick, a renegade New York Democrat who became a force in San Francisco politics in 1849, and his archrival William Gwin, a major Mississippi slaveholder and politician who arrived in California with the intent of making it a slave state and himself one of its first senators. Richards recounts the Washington battles involving Taylor, Clay, Calhoun, Douglas, Davis, Webster, Fillmore, and others, as well as the fiery California political battles, feuds, duels, and perhaps outright murder as the state came shockingly close to being divided in two.<br><br>When war did break out efforts were made to push California to secede, but there was little general enthusiasm for secession, and many prominent Southerners went off to join the Confederate Army. And with the South out of the Union, the Pacific Railroad Act passed, insuring a comfortably northern route.</p><p>Leonard L.

He lives in Amherst, Massachusetts.<b>Chapter 1</b><br>The chain of events that led to the killing began in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada on a cold morning in late January 1848. That morning, as every morning for the past several months, Jennie Wimmer had been working over a hot woodstove. Her task at the moment was making soap. Technically, she was the cook and laundress for a crew of white men, mainly Mormons, who were building a sawmill on the south fork of the American River. In fact, however, she had so alienated the Mormons that they no longer ate at her table.<br><br>Initially the men had welcomed her. Tired of their own cooking and eager to have a woman in the kitchen, they had even accepted the fact that she always served the choice portions of pork and mutton to her husband, Peter, and her seven children. But she had treated them shabbily and worn out her welcome. Whenever she rang the dinner bell, she had expected them to appear at once, and on Christmas morning, when they had taken extra time washing up, she had bawled them out, telling them that &#x201c;she was Boss&#x201d; and that they &#x201c;must come at the first call&#x201d; or go without breakfast. With that, they had &#x201c;revolted from under her government&#x201d; and decided to build their own separate cabin and cook for themselves.<br><br>What had made matters worse was that Jennie Wimmer wasn&#x2019;t an old tyrant. She was a young one, just twenty-six years old, much younger than some of the men. She also cursed, and, like most white women in California at this time, she had been around.<br><br>Christened Elizabeth Jane, but always called Jennie, she was the daughter of a Virginia tobacco farmer who in 1838 had moved his family to Lumpkin County, Georgia, to mine gold. There she and her mother had run a boardinghouse for local miners, and there she had met a young miner named Obadiah Baiz. They had married and moved to Missouri in 1840. He had died in 1843, leaving her a widow with two children. She then married Peter Wimmer, a thirty-three-year-old widower from Cincinnati with five children. In the spring of 1846 the Wimmers decided to leave the United States and head west to Mexican California. They joined a wagon train of eighty-four migrants, trekked across the Rockies and Sierras, and arrived at Sutter&#x2019;s Fort, in what is now Sacramento, on November 15, 1846.<br><br>The following spring the owner of the fort, Johann Sutter, decided to build a sawmill for his rapidly expanding agricultural empire. He, too, had been around. He had fled Switzerland for New York in 1834, leaving behind a wife and four children, large debts, and a warrant for his arrest. He then went to Missouri, New Mexico, Oregon, Hawaii, and Alaska before he reached California in 1839. Since then he had become a Mexican citizen and persuaded the governor of California to grant him a huge tract of land in the Sacramento valley, which he had dubbed New Helvetia. He was now forty-four years old and saw nothing but glory days lying ahead.<br><br>The site Sutter picked for his sawmill was some forty miles from his home base, on the south fork of the American River, in a place that came to be known as Coloma. Had Sutter been in his native Switzerland, he could have found plenty of millwrights who knew how to tap the power of falling water. But in the Sacramento valley finding a skilled millwright or even a millwright&#x2019;s apprentice was next to impossible. So to oversee the operation Sutter turned to James Marshall, a thirty-seven-year-old New Jersey carpenter who had tried his hand at ranching in the Sacramento valley and failed miserably.<br><br>Sutter assigned thirteen of his Mormon hands to work under Marshall. They were part of a larger contingent of eight hundred Mormons who had been sent by Salt Lake City to earn money fighting in the Mexican War. This contingent in 1847 had come to Sutter&#x2019;s Fort on their way back to Utah. About eighty had stayed to work, not for wages, but for horses and cattle to take home with them. Sutter still had nearly fifty Mormon hands. He thought that they were the best workers he had ever encountered. The men he assigned to Marshall had agreed to stay until the following spring. Then they planned to head east across the mountains to join Brigham Young and their fellow Saints on the shores of the Great Salt Lake. They, too, had been around. One of their leaders, Henry Bigler, had survived the anti-Mormon wars in Missouri and Illinois and now was an elder in the Mormon church.<br><br>Sutter also employed Maidu Indians. He essentially rented them from tribal leaders. He had for years, using some as personal servants, others to dig irrigation ditches and plant his orchards. He didn&#x2019;t think much of their work habits, but they cost him much less than the Mormons, and so he decided to have one Maidu crew dig the race for his sawmill. To oversee them he hired Jennie Wimmer&#x2019;s husband, Peter. The camp also needed a cook and a laundress, and for those duties Sutter hired Jennie, not knowing that her dictatorial ways would drive Henry Bigler and his fellow Mormons to the point of rebellion.<br><br>As luck would have it, however, Jennie Wimmer had one skill that the others lacked. Thanks to her time in Georgia, she knew how to tell the difference between gold and fool&#x2019;s gold. That knowledge proved helpful when Peter brought to her kitchen a pebble that James Marshall had found earlier that morning in the freshly dug tail race. The find had excited Marshall, so much so that he ran back to his Mormon crew, shouting: &#x201c;Boys, by God I believe I have found a gold mine!&#x201d;<br><br>The workers, however, had been skeptical. They had tested the metal, biting and hammering it to see if it was brittle, and found that it was malleable. But they still had doubts. So, too, did Marshall. The chips he found just didn&#x2019;t have enough luster, he thought, to be gold. Didn&#x2019;t gold glisten? He wasn&#x2019;t certain. Nor was Peter. But Jennie knew what to do with the pebble Peter handed her. She tossed it into a kettle of soap she was making, knowing that it would corrode if it was fool&#x2019;s gold. She then finished making the soap and set it off to cool. The next morning one of the hands asked her about the pebble. &#x201c;I told him it was in my soap kettle. . . . A plank was brought for me to lay my soap onto, and I cut it in chunks, but it was not to be found. At the bottom of the pot was a double handful of potash, which I lifted in my two hands, and there was my gold as bright as could be.&#x201d;<br><br>James Marshall then braved a drenching rain to take the news to Sutter. He found Sutter writing at his office desk, totally surprised to see him. Hadn&#x2019;t Marshall just received all the supplies he needed? To Sutter&#x2019;s further surprise, Marshall then insisted that the door be locked and asked for two pails of water and a scale. He then showed Sutter what he had found, and the two men spent the next couple of hours consulting the <i>American Encyclopedia</i> and doing one experiment after another. They bit and hammered the metal to see if it was malleable. They doused it with nitric acid to see if it would tarnish. They weighed it against silver. They weighed it a second time&#x2014;and then a third. They immersed the scales into a pail of water to see if it had greater specific gravity and sunk to the bottom. Finally, after again consulting the <i>American Encyclopedia</i>, they pronounced it gold.<br><br>Sutter decided that the discovery must be kept secret. The next day he rode up to Coloma. &#x201c;I had a talk with my employed people all at the Sawmill&#x201d; and asked &#x201c;that they would do me the great favor and keep it a secret.&#x201d; But he forgot to silence Jennie Wimmer and her sons. They told all who came by, including a teamster, Jacob Wittner, who carried the news back to Sutter&#x2019;s Fort. Sutter himself also had loose lips, and by March the news had reached San Francisco.<br>The first reports were dismissed as nonsense. Legends, talk, and boasts of gold had been heard many times before. Just six years earlier, in 1842, gold had been found in the mountains just north of Los Angeles, but the find played out quickly. Maybe Coloma would just be more of the same. The two weekly San Francisco newspapers, <i>The Californian</i> and <i>The California Star</i>, treated the first reports with casual indifference.<br><br>In downplaying the reports, the <i>Star</i>&#x2019;s owner had an ulterior motive. The newspaper belonged to Sam Brannan, a dapper and friendly man who seemingly spent half his time serving God, the other half serving mammon. A twenty-nine-year-old Maine native, Brannan had been a Mormon leader for most of his adult life. When he was fourteen years old, his sister had married a Mormon missionary, and he tagged along with the honeymoon couple to what was then the Mormon headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio. He had converted to the faith, helped build the first temple, and become a printer. He was then sent to New York City as the East Coast publisher of Mormon literature. He made valuable commercial contacts there and by age twenty-five had become a rich man.<br><br>Then, in 1844, when anti-Mormonism erupted into a full-scale war in Illinois and the killing of the church&#x2019;s founder, Joseph Smith, in a Carthage jail, Brannan was ordered to move the East Coast Mormons out of the United States to safer ground. Brannan bought a schooner, the <i>Brooklyn</i>, to transport seventy men, sixty-eight women, and a hundred children. They sailed south, around Cape Horn, to what was supposed to be a sparsely populated haven in northern Mexico. They arrived in Yerba Buena, soon to be renamed San Francisco, on the last day of July 1846. The town was a sleepy place, a shack town of maybe five hundred residents. There, to Brannan&#x2019;s disgust, he saw an American flag flying, signaling that California was about to become U.S. property.<br><br>Brannan didn&#x2019;t bring just his people to California. He also brought his entrepreneurial skills. On the <i>Brooklyn</i> he had loaded a printing press, the makings of a sawmill and a flour mill, and tools ...</p><h2>The Cairo Affair: A Novel</h2><p><p>From the author of <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Tourist...</i><br><i></i><br> <b>Three players.

This is Steinhauer&#x2019;s ninth novel, the first since his successful <em>Tourist</em> trilogy. A standalone, <em>The Cairo Affair</em> feels timely and relevant, cleverly relying on recent world events--a Wikileaks transcript, Gaddafi&#x2019;s overthrow, the Arab Spring. More than an espionage thriller, this is a complicated geo-political story and, at its core, the story of a flawed marriage, full of betrayals and dangerous lies. It&#x2019;s also an ambitious undertaking for Steinhauer. While his <em>Tourist</em> series featured rogue CIA agent Milo Weaver, <em>The Cairo Affair</em> is a complex narrative, entwining the stories of multiple characters, primarily a disloyal wife, her ex-lover, an Egyptian intelligence agent, and a CIA analyst. Pinballing across time and place, from Hungary to Libya, Yugoslavia to Egypt, featuring spooks named Rainman, Stumbler, and Sledgehammer, the puzzle pieces come together in a moody, low-tech, and unpredictable reveal. Having followed Steinhauer&#x2019;s trajectory over the years, it&#x2019;s a pleasure to experience a writer pushing himself--into le Carre territory, no less. <em>--Neal Thompson</em></p><p><b>Three players.

Thompson&#39;s recollection of his perception of the 1960s and a portrait of a writer of huge intelligence who is forced to live as an outsider, with rage and humour as the only tools with which to force his way in. Hunter S. Thompson&#39;s work includes &#34;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#34;, &#34;Hell&#39;s Angels&#34;, &#34;Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail&#34; and &#34;Better than Sex&#34;. Much influenced by Hemingway, George Orwell, Jack Kerouac, Tom Wolfe and Ken Kesey, he is the founder of &#39;gonzo&#39; journalism, which is essentially injecting fiction into journalism in order to give the reader a truer vision of the subject-matter. His books have all been written in gonzo form, usually with him as a central character. This volume contains the best of his letters from 1955 to 1967 (age 17 to 29) and is, therefore, his first work of non-fiction and the closest thing to true autobiography that will every publish. Readers learn that rather than being simply a genius, hopelessly addicted to drugs and alcohol, Thompson is a high-minded man, whose rage and drug-taking derive from his clear-sighted understanding of how much better the world - in particular America - could be.</p><p>This first volume of the correspondence of Hunter S. Thompson begins with a high school essay and runs up through the publication of Thompson's breakout book, <i>Hell's Angels</i>. Thompson apparently never threw a letter away, so the reader has the treat of experiencing the full evolution of his pyrotechnic writing style, rant by rant. The letters--to girlfriends, to bill collectors, to placers of "Help Wanted" ads, to editors and publishers--are usually spiced with political commentary. The style and the political animus always seem to drive each other. For instance, an 11/22/63 letter to novelist and friend William J. Kennedy about the day's cataclysm is apparently the birthplace of the signal phrase "fear and loathing." (Thompson summed up the Kennedy assassination thus: "The savage nuts have shattered the great myth of American decency.") And the willingness to write strangers is stunning: this collection includes Thompson's letter to LBJ seeking appointment to the governorship of American Samoa. You might have thought Garry Trudeau was exaggerating in his <i>Doonesbury</i> characterization of the Thompson-based character Duke. He was not.I recommended this one to my twenty-five-year old brother. Some of what I saw inside the book seemed to cater to his sense of humor and his desire for the truth. He loved it. He told me he read it on the plane on a business trip and couldn't put it down.<br><br>Eileen Gaffney, Associate Managing Editor</p><h2>The Raven Steals the Light</h2><p><p>An elegant reissue of a timeless collection of Haida myths, with a new preface by <b>Claude Levi-Strauss</b>.</p><br><p>Ten masterful, complex drawings by <b>Bill Reid</b> are accompanied by ten episodes from Haida mythology told by <b>Bill Reid</b> and <b>Robert Bringhurst</b>.

In the rear, Doc encounters a straw-haired mid-western farm boy who shows him how to prepare a meal of long-rats, and Loopie, a Puerto Rican from the Bronx who shares a guilt-torn confession that borders on confabulation. In the bush, Doc experiences the terror of accidentally releasing a live grenade among his men, of rushing to rescue a wounded marine, and of sharing a quiet conversation in a bunker with Trang, a South Vietnamese soldier.<br><br>After being assigned to the Recon Dive Team and attending the Navy diving school in the Philip-pines, he returns to Viet Nam were he engages in numerous combat dives and river operations.<br><br>At the end of his tour, he is processed out of the military. And upon his return to his hometown as a veteran, he faces a jarring reception of insolence, indifference, and fragmented flashbacks. In <em><strong>Viet Man</strong></em>, D.S. Lliteras unlocks the inner mystery of a man&#x2019;s combat experience. It is poetic and haunting, authentic and amusing. It is a story told by a man who ultimately survives the war and returns to his homeland, but another country will<br>forever dwell in his soul.</p></p><p><p><strong>D. S. Lliteras</strong>&nbsp;is the author of fourteen books that have received national and international acclaim.&nbsp;His short stories and poetry have appeared in numerous national and international magazines, journals, and anthologies. He lives in Montgomery, Alabama with his wife and author, Kathleen Touchstone.</p><p>From <em><strong>Literary Aficionado</strong></em></p> <p>by Grady Harp<br><br>D.S. Lliteras has looked at the 20th century and found it wanting. Or rather, the audience for excellent literautre has yet to recognize his importance so perhaps it is we, the wanters, who are still lost, searching for a voice to define the last fifty or so years. His credentials are impressive: he has written twelve books since 1992, his first novels were biblical in nature and while they gained accolades from the press it was only when he decided to enter and related that part of his psyche that was most vulnerable that his books burst into significance. Lliteras joined the US Navy after high school and became a corpseman assigned to the USMC First Reconaissance Battalion First Marine Division near DaNang, winning a Bronze Star for valor. He was trained as a diver and further endured the Vietnam War in that role. Following his discharge from the USN he gained his BA and MA in Fine Arts from Florida State University and worked as a theatrical director until 1979, resigning to become a merchant sailor. In 1981 he aligned with the USN as a deep sea diving and salvage officer, following which he resigned his naval commission and became a professional firefighter. And yes, all of this is pertinent to the content of this, his newest and most brilliant book.<br><br>There are many novels written about all aspects of the Vietnam War--some famous for recreating all aspects of the Vietnam War--some famous for recreating the atmosphere of that major mistake in US history both in the ill-defined battle ground of Vietnam and in the rebellion by those in the US who either violently protested the war or ran way from it to Canada--but to date this reader (who served in Vietnam from 1968-1970 in the same region as the author assigned by the USN to the USMC, etc) has not encountered a novel that breathes the humid musky air of that jungle war so accurately as does Lliteras'&nbsp;<strong><em>Viet Man</em></strong>: even the title is telling--about the mixed emotion of participating in that war. As a corpsman Lliteras takes us through his arrival in Danang, his preparation for recon search and destroy missions with the Marines, his response to every aspect of that robbed year of service, the terror of near death episodes, the ever-respect paranoia of not knowing where the 'enemy' was, the physical exhaustion of patrols and combat enounters, yet he also shows a very human aspect of the interdependence among his marines, the humor, the use of drugs and other escape hatches to breathe outside the line of fire if only for moments, and the bonding with men on whom to depend for protection while he provided medical readiness for the results of engagement.<br><br>But one aspect (of many) that makes his book so rich and so real is his extraordinarily literate ability to place his descriptions of thoughts poetically while relating the acrid details of the war zone thinking in piercingly penetrating, sharp prose. He compares 'Patrol Reports' (set on gray sheets and all in military terminology) with his relating from a corpsman's mind and memory what really happened. This attention to both feelings and observed details is what makes the books more credible--and it is that combination that makes his eventual return to the US to find a country that seems to disregard him as a meaningless non-existent piece of unnecessary reminder dung that we all felt when returning "home" to the country for whom we had placed our lives on hold in a zone of persistent cerebral damage we are still feeling--it is that aspect that has been missing.<br><br>What&nbsp;<strong><em>Viet Man&nbsp;</em></strong>offers us is not only a work worth of literary accolades, but a tribute to a time when the world was confused and tenuous--as we have never been able to understand why, until now, where between the covers of this book we find our own Wilfred Owen. Highly Recommended.</p></p><h2>Monster</h2><p>Monster is what the prosecutor called 16-year-old Steve Harmon. Is he really a monster, or was he just in the wrong place at the wrong time?</p><p>"Monster" is what the prosecutor called 16-year-old Steve Harmon for his supposed role in the fatal shooting of a convenience-store owner. But was Steve really the lookout who gave the "all clear" to the murderer, or was he just in the wrong place at the wrong time? In this innovative novel by Walter Dean Myers, the reader becomes both juror and witness during the trial of Steve's life. To calm his nerves as he sits in the courtroom, aspiring filmmaker Steve chronicles the proceedings in movie script format. Interspersed throughout his screenplay are journal writings that provide insight into Steve's life before the murder and his feelings about being held in prison during the trial. "They take away your shoelaces and your belt so you can't kill yourself no matter how bad it is. I guess making you live is part of the punishment."<p> Myers, known for the inner-city classic <i>Motown and Didi</i> (first published in 1984), proves with <i>Monster</i> that he has kept up with both the struggles and the lingo of today's teens. Steve is an adolescent caught up in the violent circumstances of an adult world--a situation most teens can relate to on some level. Readers will no doubt be attracted to the novel's handwriting-style typeface, emphasis on dialogue, and fast-paced courtroom action. By weaving together Steve's journal entries and his script, Myers has given the first-person voice a new twist and added yet another worthy volume to his already admirable body of work.

A Harlem drugstore owner was shot and killed in his store, and the word is that Steve served as the lookout.</p><p>Guilty or innocent, Steve becomes a pawn in the hands of "the system," cluttered with cynical authority figures and unscrupulous inmates, who will turn in anyone to shorten their own sentences. For the first time, Steve is forced to think about who he is as he faces prison, where he may spend all the tomorrows of his life.</p><p>As a way of coping with the horrific events that entangle him, Steve, an amateur filmmaker, decides to transcribe his trial into a script, just like in the movies. He writes it all down, scene by scene, the story of how his whole life was turned around in an instant. But despite his efforts, reality is blurred and his vision obscured until he can no longer tell who he is or what is the truth. This compelling novel is Walter Dean Myers's writing at its best.</p><p> 2000 Coretta Scott King Honor Book, 2000 Michael L.

Kenner's style is as lively and unpredictable as his intellect and perceptions; these pieces set a high standard for popular writing.<br><i>- Richard Kuczkowski, Dominican Coll., Blauvelt, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Portable Mentor for Organizational Leaders</h2><p>&#34;A Portable Mentor&#34; is a must-read for organizations looking to achieve leadership and excellence in their fields.

In all likelihood, one of the first medicinal drugs known to mankind, opium and its derivatives have eased and caused suffering in almost equal measure, a fact that the evenhanded Booth takes pains to point out. In fact, he quotes rock musician Frank Zappa with approbation: "A drug is neither moral nor immoral--it's a chemical compound. The compound itself is not a menace to society until a human being treats it as if consumption bestowed a temporary license to act like an asshole." Booth's book traces opium's history from the first evidence of poppy cultivation (possibly as early as 4,000 B.C.) to the drug wars of today, exploring its uses in different cultures, its roles in British and Chinese political affairs, its use by artists and musicians, and its horrifying ramifications for addicts. <p> Booth writes with admirable attention to detail, if very little �lan. Plowing through some of his sentences is a little like chewing on a mouthful of sawdust: "There are several reasons suggested for the popularity of the hypodermic but the primary one is the lowering standard of heroin purity caused by the success of legislation on production and by the selling methods employed by Italians who took over distribution from Jewish gangs, leading to an increase in price and higher levels of adulteration." It's enough to drive a reader to drugs. Nonetheless, the power of his narrative can't be entirely erased by the unwieldiness of his prose. The book is filled with striking images and surprising facts--for instance, opium-addicted Victorian children, fed "soothing syrups" by minders to keep them quiet. Undernourished, yellow-skinned, in the words of one contemporary observer, they "shrank up into little old men or wizened like a little monkey." In the end, Booth finds few answers to the problems posed by the opium trade--a scourge he says has "destroyed millions of lives, enslaved whole cultures and invidiously corrupted human society to its very core." In writing this exhaustively researched history, however, Booth brings us that much closer to understanding--and thereby conquering--the most tenacious of human addictions. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>"A great sprawling catalogue of sheer information about opium and its effects over the last 4,000 years, during which it has always been both a blessing and a curse." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p> "The book's wealth of detail is remarkable." --<i>The Economist</i></p><p> "<i>Opium</i> is of great value for its thoroughness, and it is briskly written....Each chapter [is] a ball of opium with an explosive charge." --<i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p> "Booth takes us from <i>P. somniferum</i> to 'black gold,' compellingly documenting the influential role of the opiate trade throughout history." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p> "From the subtleties of Chinese history to the complexities of Golden Triangle narco-nationalism...Booth shows us a sure grasp of his material and manages to pull the innumerable and far-flung threads...neatly together." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>While the Women Are Sleeping</h2><p><p><strong>A dozen unforgettable stories by &#x201c;one of the most original writers at work today&#x201d; (Wyatt Mason, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>).</strong></p> Slippery figures in anomalous situations &#x2015; ghosts, spies, bodyguards, criminals &#x2015; haunt these stories by Javier Mar�as: the characters come bearing their strange and special secrets, and never leave our minds. In one story, a man obsessed with his much younger lover endlessly videotapes her every move, and then confides his surprising plans for her; in another a ghost can&#x2019;t stop resigning from his job. Masterfully, Mar�as manages in a small space to perplex and delight. &#x201c;The short story fits Mar�as like a glove,&#x201d; as <em>Le Point</em> noted. His stories have been hailed as &#x201c;formidably intelligent&#x201d; (<em>The London Review of Books</em>), &#x201c;a bracing tonic&#x201d; (<em>Chicago Tribune</em>), and &#x201c;startling&#x201d; (<em>The New York Times Book Review</em>).</p><p><p><strong>Javier Mar�as</strong> is an award-winning Spanish novelist. He is also a translator and columnist, as well as the current king of Redonda. He was born in Madrid in 1951 and published his first novel at the age of nineteen. He has held academic posts in Spain, the US (he was a visiting professor at Wellesley College) and Britain, as a lecturer in Spanish Literature at Oxford University. He has been translated into 34 languages, and more than six million copies of his books have been sold worldwide. In 1997 he won the Nelly Sachs Award; the Comunidad de Madrid award in 1998; in 2000 the Grinzane Cavour Award, the Alberto Moravia Prize, and the Dublin IMPAC Award. He also won the Spanish National Translation Award in 1979 for his translation of <em>Tristram Shandy</em> in 1979. He was a professor at Oxford University and the Complutense of Madrid. He currently lives in Madrid.</p><p>Award-winning translator <strong>Margaret Jull Costa</strong> lives in England.&nbsp;</p>These 10 stories underscore Marias's mastery of the surreal and evasive, but nobody will confuse this sampler of leftover stories with the author's best work. In the satisfying title story, an unnamed narrator, lying on the beach with his wife, can't stop speculating about the lives of another pair of beach goers: a much older man and a beautiful young woman named In�s. He eventually befriends the man, Alberto Viana, who confesses a desperate obsession with In�s, but Alberto's story doesn't satisfy the narrator, as it doesn't jibe with his invented scenario. The other longish story, "The Resignation Letter of Se�or de Santiesteban," follows a young teacher named Derek Lilburn, whose new post at a prestigious school is jeopardized when he can't accept the existence of the story's title character, a benign ghost. Most of the rest of the stories feel under-developed, like sketches inspired by a clever idea, from doppelg�ngers to being stuck on an elevator. Marias (the Your Face Tomorrow trilogy) is a brilliant stylist and formidable intellect, but this haphazard collection does little to further his reputation. (Nov.)

In Love &amp; Sleep, the second volume of the series, the professor Pierce Moffett finds himself at a great turning point in the history of the world. As a child, Pierce was no stranger to magic, but those revelations faded with time. Now Pierce's search for a secret history of the world&#x2015;one in which magic works and angels speak to humankind&#x2015;has begun again. Love &amp; Sleep is followed by the third volume in the �gypt cycle, D�monomania, and the fourth, Endless Things.</p><p>"From John Crowley, author of <i>Little, Big</i>, comes a major work of American magic realism set in the same realm of infinite possibility as his critically acclaimed <i>Egypt (a New York Times</i> "notable Book" for 1987). <i>Love</i> &amp; <i>Sleep</i> revolves around Pierce Moffett, who as a boy was no stranger to magic, scratching the surface of ordinary life to find something glittering and strange underneath. For most children, these revelations fade with time, but for the adult Pierce -- struggling to retain the youthful vision and innocence of childhood -- the search for the hidden history of the world is just beginning. An eloquent treatise on the secrets of life, <i>Love</i> &amp; <i>Sleep</i> proves Crowley to be one of American literature's most original and valuable treasures. <p> "John Crowley is an abundantly gifted writer, a scholar whose passion for history is matched by his ability to write a graceful sentence." -- <i>New York Times Book Review</i>. </p><p> "Crowley is generous, obsessed, fascinating, gripping. Really, I think Crowley is so good that he has left everybody else in the dust." -- <i>Peter Straub</i> </p><p> "A master of language, plot and characterization, Crowley triumphs in this occult and Herrnetic tale, at once naturalistically persuasive and uncannily visionary. <i>Love &amp; Sleep</i> rewards endless rereading, as does <i>Little, Big</i>." -- Harold Bloom, author of <i>The Book Of J.</i></p>John Crowley was born in the appropriately liminal town of Presque Isle, Maine, in 1942, his father then an officer in the US Army Air Corps. He grew up in Vermont, northeastern Kentucky and (for the longest stretch) Indiana, where he went to high school and college. He moved to New York City after college to make movies, and did find work in documentary films, an occupation he still pursues. He published his first novel (The Deep) in 1975, and his 14th volume of fiction (Lord Byron&#39;s Novel: The Evening Land) in 2005. Since 1993 he has taught creative writing at Yale University. In 1992 he received the Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

But when he meets Captain Meriwether Lewis, Seaman finds himself on a path that will make history. Lewis is just setting off on his landmark search for the Northwest Passage, and he takes Seaman along. Sharing the curiosity and strength of spirit of his new master, Seaman proves himself a valuable companion at every turn. Part history, part science--and adventure through and through--<i>The Captain&#x2019;s Dog</i> is the carefully researched, thrilling tale of America&#x2019;s greatest journey of discovery, as seen through the keen, compassionate eyes of a remarkable dog.<br></p><p>Roland Smith is a former zookeeper and leading expert on red wolves as well as an author. He lives on a small farm near Portland, Oregon.Grade 5-8-This is the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition as witnessed by Seaman, the massive Newfoundland dog that accompanied the two captains. Faithful to their original diaries, the novel brings to life the day-to-day challenges faced by the team charged with the task of exploring the American West and searching for the legendary Northwest Passage. Action and adventure abound: frequent attacks by grizzly bears and voracious mosquitoes, arduous crossings of nearly impassable landscapes, mutiny and desertion, and close encounters with both friendly and hostile Indians. However, while Seaman's narration is inventive, Smith has difficulty sustaining it, mainly because the dog is such a minor player in the momentous events that he describes. His point of view often seems too omniscient and introspective, resulting in a narrative that sounds uncomfortably human.

Cold. Dark. Where was the surface? I kicked in all directions, trying to find my way up. I twisted and turned, and then I saw it: a light. Dim, pale, and far away.<br><br>Instinctively I shot for it, and quickly noticed that the water around me was growing brighter. That had to be the surface, the sun.<br><br>But how could the sun be . . . square? I must be seeing things. Maybe some trick of the water.<br><br>Who cares! How much air do I have left? Just get to it. Swim!<br><br>My lungs ballooned, little bubbles escaping from my lips, racing me for the distant light. I kicked and clawed the water like a caged animal. Now I could see it, a ceiling of ripples coming closer with each desperate stroke. Closer, but still so far away. My body ached, my lungs burned.<br><br>Swim! SWIM!<br><br>Crack!<br><br>My body writhed as a sudden jolt of pain shot from toes to eyes. My mouth opened in a choked scream. I reached for the glow, grabbing for breath, for life.<br><br>I exploded into the cool, clean air.<br><br>I coughed. I choked. I wheezed. I laughed.<br><br>Breathing.<br><br>For a moment, I just savored the experience, closing my eyes and letting the sun warm my face. But when I opened my eyes, I couldn&#x2019;t believe them. The sun was square! I blinked hard. The clouds, too? Instead of round puffy cotton balls, these thin, rectangular objects floated lazily above me.<br><br>You&#x2019;re still seeing things, I thought. You hit your head when you fell off the boat and now you&#x2019;re a little dazed.<br><br>But did I fall off a boat? I couldn&#x2019;t remember. I couldn&#x2019;t remember anything, in fact; how I got here, or even where &#x201c;here&#x201d; was.<br><br>&#x201c;Help me!&#x201d; I shouted, scanning the horizon for a ship or a plane or even a speck of land. &#x201c;Please, somebody! Anybody! HELP!&#x201d; All I got was silence. All I could see was water and sky.<br><br>I was alone.<br><br>Almost.<br><br>Something splashed inches from my face, a flash of tentacles and a thick, black and grayish head.<br><br>I yelped, kicking backward. It looked like a squid, but square like everything else in this strange place. The tentacles turned to me, opening wide. I gazed right into a yawning red mouth ringed with white razor teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;Get outta here!&#x201d; I hollered. Mouth dry, heart pounding, I splashed clumsily away from the creature. I didn&#x2019;t have to. At that moment, the tentacles closed, blasting the squid in the other direction.<br><br>I floated there, frozen, treading water for a few seconds, until the animal disappeared into the deep. That&#x2019;s when I let out a long, throaty, tension-�draining &#x201c;ughhh.&#x201d;<br><br>I took another deep breath, then another, then a whole lot more. Finally, my heart settled down, my limbs stopped jerking, and, for the first time since I woke up, my brain switched on.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said aloud. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re way out in a lake or ocean or whatever. No one&#x2019;s coming to save you, and you can&#x2019;t tread water forever.&#x201d;<br><br>I did a slow, 360-�degree turn, hoping to see some thread of coastline I&#x2019;d missed before. Nothing. In desperation I tried one last scan of the sky. No planes, not even a thin white trail. What sky doesn&#x2019;t have those trails? One with a square sun and rectangle clouds.<br><br>The clouds.<br><br>I noticed they were all moving steadily in one direction, away from the rising sun. Due west.<br><br>&#x201c;As good as anywhere,&#x201d; I said, giving another deep sigh, and started swimming slowly west.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t much to go on, but I figured the wind might help me along a little bit, or at least wouldn&#x2019;t slow me down. And if I went north or south, the breeze might slowly blow me in an arc so I&#x2019;d end up swimming in circles. I didn&#x2019;t know if that was really true. I still don&#x2019;t. I mean, c&#x2019;mon, I&#x2019;d just woken up, probably with some kind of massive head injury, at the bottom of an ocean, and was trying really, really hard not to end up back there.<br><br>Just keep going, I told myself. Focus on what&#x2019;s ahead. I began to notice how weird my &#x201c;swimming&#x201d; was; not the stroke, pause, stroke motion, but the sense of gliding across the water with my limbs along for the ride.<br><br>Head injury, I thought, trying not to imagine how serious that injury might be.<br><br>One good thing, I noticed, was that I didn&#x2019;t seem to be getting tired. Isn&#x2019;t swimming supposed to be exhausting? Don&#x2019;t your muscles burn and quit after a while? Adrenaline, I thought, and tried not to imagine that emergency gas tank running out.<br><br>But it would. Sooner or later, I&#x2019;d lose steam, cramp up, go from swimming to treading water, then from treading water to floating. Of course, I&#x2019;d try to rest, bobbing up and down to conserve energy, but how long could I keep that up? How long before the cold of the water finally got to me? How long before, teeth chattering, body shivering, I finally sank back down into the darkness?<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet!&#x201d; I blurted out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not giving up yet!&#x201d;<br><br>Shouting out loud was enough to perk me up. &#x201c;Keep focused! Keep going!&#x201d;<br><br>And I did. I kept swimming with all my might. I also tried to be �ber-�aware of my surroundings. Hopefully I would spot the mast of a ship or the shadow of a helicopter, but at the very least, it would take my mind off my current predicament!<br><br>I noticed that the water was calm, and this gave me something to feel good about. No waves meant no resistance, which meant I could swim farther, right? I also noticed that the water was fresh, not salty, which meant that I had to be in a lake instead of an ocean, and lakes are smaller than oceans. Okay, a big lake is just as dangerous as an ocean, but c&#x2019;mon, you got a problem with me trying to look on the bright side?<br><br>I also noticed that I could see the bottom. It was deep&#x2014;�don&#x2019;t get me wrong, you could sink a pretty decent office building and never see the top&#x2014;�but it wasn&#x2019;t bottomless like the ocean is supposed to be. I could also see it wasn&#x2019;t level. There were tons of little valleys and hills.<br><br>That was when, off to my right, I noticed that one of the hills had grown so tall that its top disappeared beyond the horizon. Did it break the surface? I turned north, northwest, I guess, and swam in a straight line for the hill.<br><br>And before I knew it, the hill grew into an underwater mountain. And a few seconds later, I actually thought I saw its top sprout above the water.<br><br>That&#x2019;s gotta be land, I thought, trying not to get my hopes up. It could be a mirage though, a trick of the light or some mist or . . . <br><br>That&#x2019;s when I saw the tree. At least I thought it was a tree, because, from that distance, all I could make out was a dark green angular mass perched atop a dark brown line.<br><br>Excitement propelled me like a torpedo. Eyes locked forward, I soon saw other trees dotting a tan beach. And then, suddenly, the green-�brown slope of a hill.<br><br>&#x201c;Land!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;LAAAND!&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;d made it! Warm, firm, solid ground! A few strokes and I&#x2019;d be there. A wave of total relief washed over me . . . and just like a real wave it washed right back out.<br><br>I barely had a second to celebrate before the island came into full view. By the time I reached the shore, I was just as confused as the moment I&#x2019;d woken up.<br><br>The island was square. Or, rather, it was made of squares. Everything: sand, dirt, rocks, even those things I first thought were trees. Everything was a combination of cubes. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, refusing to believe what I was seeing. &#x201c;Just need a minute is all, just a minute.&#x201d; Standing in waist-�high water, breathing, blinking, I waited for my eyes to clear. I was sure that any minute, all those harsh right angles would return to soft, curvy normalness.<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;Gotta be that head wound,&#x201d; I said, wading ashore. &#x201c;No problem. Just make sure you&#x2019;re not bleeding too bad and&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Instinctively, my hand went up to find the supposed injury, and as it came up in front of my face, I gasped.<br><br>&#x201c;Wha . . . ?&#x201d; There was a fleshy cube at the end of my rectangular arm, a cube that wouldn&#x2019;t open no matter how hard I tried. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my hand!?&#x201d; I shouted, my voice rising in panic.<br><br>Head swimming, throat closing, I looked nervously down at the rest of me.<br><br>Brick-�shaped feet, rectangular legs, a shoebox-�shaped torso, all covered in painted-�on clothes.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with me!?&#x201d; I hollered to the empty beach.<br><br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t real!&#x201d; I screamed, running back and forth, trying to tear the painted clothes off my body.<br><br>Hyperventilating, I rushed back to the water, desperate for the calming reflection of my face. Nothing greeted me. &#x201c;Where am I?&#x201d; I shouted to the shimmering sea. &#x201c;What is this place?&#x201d;<br><br>I thought of the water, of how I&#x2019;d woken up . . . but had I?<br><br>&#x201c;This is a dream!&#x201d; I said, relief breaking into my panicked voice, reaching for the only thing I could think of. &#x201c;Of course!&#x201d; And for a second I almost pulled myself together. &#x201c;Just a crazy dream, and soon you&#x2019;ll wake up and . . .&#x201d;<br><br>And what? I tried to imagine waking up in my home, in my life, but it was all gone. I could remember the world, the real world of soft, round shapes, of people and houses and cars and lives. I just couldn&#x2019;t remember me in it.<br><br>My vision narrowed as an invisible fist closed around my lungs. &#x201c;Who am I?&#x201d;<br><br>Tension pulsed up through the veins in my neck. I could feel the skin on my face, the roots of my teeth. Dizzy, nauseous, I staggered back against the base of the hill. What was my name? What did I look like? Was I old? Was I young?<br><br>Looking down at my boxy body, I couldn&#x2019;t determine anything. Was I a man or a woman? Was I even human?<br><br>&#x201c;What am I?&#x201d;<br><br>The thread snapped. My mind collapsed.<br><br>Where? Who? What? And now the final question.<br><br>&#x201c;Why!?&#x201d; I screeched up at the bright square sun. &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t I remember? Why am I different? Why am I here? Why is all of this happening to me? WHYYY!?&#x201d;<br><br>All I got back was silence. No birds, no waves, not even the rustle of wind through those angular excuses for trees. Nothing but pure, punishing silence.<br><br>And then . . . <br><br>Grrrp.<br><br>The sound was so small I wasn&#x2019;t sure I&#x2019;d heard it.<br><br>Grrrp.<br><br>I definitely heard it that time, and felt it, too. It was coming from inside me. My tummy was rumbling.<br><br>I&#x2019;m hungry.<br><br>That was all I needed to break my downward spiral. Something to do, something simple and clear to focus on, and next to breathing, there&#x2019;s nothing clearer or simpler than eating.<br><br>Grrrp, growled my stomach, as if to say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting.&#x201d;<br><br>I shook my head violently, trying to get the blood back in my cheeks, and looked down at my body to see if I had anything to eat. I&#x2019;d been so shocked the first time I&#x2019;d seen myself that I might have missed something earlier. Maybe I had a waterproof phone in my pocket, or even a wallet with my ID.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t have either, or even pockets. But what I did find was a thin belt, painted the same color as my pants&#x2014;�another reason I&#x2019;d missed it the first time&#x2014;�with four flat pouches on either side. Each pouch was empty, but while going through them, I suddenly realized I could feel the slight pressure of something resting gently on my back.<br><br>I call it a &#x201c;backpack&#x201d; but it didn&#x2019;t have any straps or hooks or anything that should have held it in place. It was just stuck there, and like the belt and my painted-�on clothes, I couldn&#x2019;t take it off. All I could do was reach back and swing it to the front.<br><br>&#x201c;Crazy dream,&#x201d; I said, coming back to the only mental crutch I had. The pack&#x2019;s inside was lined with twenty-�seven small pouches, just like those on the belt, and also totally empty.<br><br>So much for taking inventory, I thought, as the feeling of hunger grew constant. That meant foraging for food. I looked around for something, anything, that looked remotely edible. At first, the only thing I could find appeared to be one-�block-�high blades of rectangular grass. They grew in ones and twos on the green-�covered dirt behind the beach. I reached down to one sprouting right at my feet, but somehow I couldn&#x2019;t pick it up. Instead I just swiped clumsily in a rapid punching motion.<br><br>Anxiety welled up in me again. It was one thing to have a strange-�looking body, but a whole new crisis to discover that that body wouldn&#x2019;t obey! I tried again, missing the grass, and again, and when I finally connected, my fist smashed my target to oblivion. And I do mean oblivion. The tall green stalks didn&#x2019;t just fall over or break, they disappeared. One quick crunching noise and poof, gone.<br><br>&#x201c;Aw, c&#x2019;mon!&#x201d; I pouted, looking at this angular appendage. &#x201c;Just work, will ya?&#x201d; For some reason, pleading with my hand wasn&#x2019;t the answer. Neither was trying to repeat the same fruitless motion on another identical clump of grass.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve heard, although I can&#x2019;t remember where, that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result. I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s true for some people, but for me, it was pretty darn close.<br><br>&#x201c;Just work!&#x201d; I grunted angrily, punching the grass like it had swung first. &#x201c;Work. Work. WORK!&#x201d; It was starting again, the mental slide. My mind was balancing on a thin tightrope at that moment, and I really needed some kind of win.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t get one, exactly, but I did break the cycle by accidentally, literally, breaking the ground. On the fourth try, I hit so hard and for so long that I didn&#x2019;t only destroy the little green blades, but also knocked away a whole block of dirt beneath them.<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa . . .&#x201d; I stammered, frustration replaced with curiosity.<br><br>At first I didn&#x2019;t see the block, just the block-�sized hole it&#x2019;d disappeared into. I peered into the divot and saw a cube floating at the bottom&#x2014;�actually hovering off the ground&#x2014;�and much smaller than it had been. I reached in to pick it up and didn&#x2019;t get halfway there before it flew up at me.</p><h2>Brain Quest 2nd Grade Q&amp;A Cards: 1000 Questions and Answers to Challenge the Mind. Curriculum-based!

Sandra Boynton's familiar furry creatures introduce simple concepts in this bright collection of four books, replete with clever line drawings. In <i>Horns and Toes and In Between</i>, three horned monsters teach the parts of the body in rhyme: "...and we have a fuzzy TUMMY that we all like to pat / and a little BELLY BUTTON in the middle of that." <i>The Going to Bed Book</i> gets a Noah's Ark of animals organized for bed: "They hang their towels on the wall / and find pajamas, big and small." <i>Opposites</i> is just that: cute animals "high and low / fast and slow / heavy and light / day and night." In the rhyming reader <i>But Not the Hippopotamus</i>, a hippo finds himself on the outs as "a cat and two rats are trying on hats. / But not the hippopotamus. / A moose and a goose together have juice. / But not the hippopotamus." Rest assured the hippo finds love at the end. (Baby to preschool) <i>--Claire Dederer</i>Sandra Boynton is a popular American cartoonist, children&#x2019;s author, songwriter, producer, and director.

She wants to be a ballerina more than anything, but she worries that her too-large feet, too-long legs, and even her big mouth will keep her from her dream. When a famous director comes to visit her class, Sassy does her best to get his attention with her high jumps and bright leotard. Her first attempts are definitely not appreciated, but with Sassy's persistence, she just might be able to win him over. <i>Dancing in the Wings</i> is loosely based on actress/choreographer Debbie Allen's own experiences as a young dancer.</p><p>Actor, director, dancer/choreographer and singer, <b>Debbie Allen</b>'s career has touched nearly every facet of the entertainment industry.<p>Allen's Broadway career as a dancer, singer and actor began in the chorus of "Purlie". She next appeared in "Raisin", then in the 1979 production West Side Story", for which she won a prestigious Drama Desk Award, as well as, her first Tony Award nomination. Allen received another Tony Award nomination in 1986 for her role as Bob Fosse's "Sweet Charity".</p><p>Allen's choreography career soared in 1980 with the international hit TV series "Fame". In 1988 she went behind the scenes to choreograph the new American Musical "Carrie with the Royal Shakespeare Company" and has continued to devote herself to that discipline. She holds the distinction of having choreographed the Academy Awards for five consecutive years. Allen collaborated with James Ingram to create "Brothers of the Knight" which played at the prestigious Kennedy Center in Washington, DC in the spring of 1998.</p>Allen currently resides in Los Angeles, California.<br><br><b>Kadir Nelson </b>is an award-winning illustrator and fine artist. He lives in San Diego, California.The creators of Brothers of the Knight here offer an inspirational story of a hopeful young ballet dancer who complains of her too-big feet and too-long legs: "I was too big for the boys to pick up, and too tall to be in line with the other girls. So I watched from backstage, dancing in the wings, hoping that if I just kept dancing and trying, it would be my turn to dance in the spotlight." Though her brother and several of her peers constantly razz her, Sassy's uncle encourages her to audition for a role in a summer dance festival, asserting, "All you gotta do to make your mark on the world is walk into a room." The director of the festival echoes this sentiment when he announcesAin the book's foreseeable denouementAthat Sassy has landed a place in his program. Allen's wordy narrative occasionally tries too hard to be hip (featuring such slang put-downs as "Your mama" and "Talk to the hand"), but this tale may well boost the confidence of youngsters who share Sassy's lack of self-assuredness. Nelson's animated illustrations depict Sassy with a grace that belies her self-image and that effectively foreshadows the accolades to come. Ages 4-8.

Follow @gzuckerman<b>Stephen Curry</b><br><br>There wasn&#x2019;t a single college willing to give Stephen Curry a chance. His dream of playing professional basketball seemed a long shot. A really long shot.<br><br>It was 2004, and Stephen was a high school sophomore. His father had played pro basketball and been a star. Steph grew up in North Carolina, close to some of the best college programs in the country, an ideal place to showcase his talent for top NCAA programs. And Steph had passion for basketball, an accurate shot, and a hunger to make it to the NBA.<br><br>But no one took Stephen very seriously. He kept hearing how he was too tiny and skinny to play Division I basketball, the top collegiate level. The NBA seemed truly out of the question. It didn&#x2019;t help that Steph had a boyish look, making him appear even younger than his seventeen years. Big-name schools kept passing on Steph, figuring he couldn&#x2019;t contribute much to their basketball programs.<br><br>Those were the schools that actually knew Steph existed. Most of the best coaches hadn&#x2019;t even heard of Steph; they sure weren&#x2019;t going to recruit him or offer him a scholarship.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even remember seeing him [during his college recruitment process],&#x201d; says Roy Williams, the legendary University of North Carolina coach. &#x201c;I do know when I did see him I thought, &#x2018;Man, he is little.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Earlier in life, Steph seemed to have a lot going for him. Steph&#x2019;s father, Dell Curry, had been a first-round draft pick who&#x2019;d played sixteen years in the NBA for five different teams. A six-foot-four shooting guard, Dell had retired from the NBA after a long career and remains the Charlotte Bobcat&#x2019;s all-time leading scorer and three-point shooter. Steph&#x2019;s mother, Sonya, had been both a basketball and volleyball state champion in high school and played varsity volleyball in college.<br><br>With such a rich athletic tradition in his family, Stephen played and enjoyed a lot of different sports growing up. But basketball was his first love.<br><br>&#x201c;I was a competitive guy,&#x201d; Steph said in an interview on ESPN, &#x201c;but something about basketball and doing what your dad did [made basketball] more of a draw.&#x201d;<br><br>Having a father in the NBA was a thrill, and Steph grew up admiring his dad and his skills on the court. His mother wouldn&#x2019;t let him go to Charlotte&#x2019;s games on school nights, though, worried he&#x2019;d be exhausted the next day and unable to concentrate on his studies. So on weekends, Steph and his younger brother, Seth, attended as many of their father&#x2019;s games as they could. It was exciting seeing the best NBA players up close; it was even more fun watching their father compete against them. Steph and Seth sometimes even got to shoot with Charlotte players during pregame warm-ups.<br><br>In eighth grade, Steph decided to dedicate himself to basketball, determined to follow in his father&#x2019;s footsteps. He began practicing year-round, committing himself to &#x201c;do whatever it took, whatever was necessary, to play in college,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>By the time Steph was a sophomore in high school, however, he ran into an imposing roadblock: He was just too small. Steph stood five foot six and weighed in at a scrawny 125 pounds.<br><br>&#x201c;On every team he ever played on, he was the smallest guy,&#x201d; his father says.<br><br>Steph was so frail that he had to begin his shooting motion well below his waist because he lacked the strength to raise the ball and shoot it from above his head. Steph&#x2019;s father knew there was no way his son could play college ball if he didn&#x2019;t change his approach. Shooting from below the waist makes it far too easy for a defender to swat the ball away. Dell knew college coaches would never recruit a player with that kind of shooting form.<br><br>One day, Dell came to Steph to deliver some unsolicited advice.<br><br>&#x201c;If you want to play in college,&#x201d; Dell said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re going to have to bring [the ball] up and get it above your head.&#x201d;<br><br>Steph was happy with his shot and wasn&#x2019;t sure he needed to make such a dramatic shift. But he eventually understood he had to transform his game if he wanted to play with bigger and better players, as his father told him.<br><br>Given his size, the NBA seemed completely out of the question for Steph, but he still wanted to play college ball, so he agreed to let his father tutor him. Steph took the summer off from his usual activities, even from playing pickup basketball games, to focus on reinventing his jump shot.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t realize how difficult the process would be. All summer long, he and his father practiced and practiced on a hoop in their backyard. But Steph didn&#x2019;t seem to make much progress. Some nights he ended up in tears.<br><br>&#x201c;It was tough for me to watch them in the backyard, late nights and a lot of hours during the day, working on the shot,&#x201d; Seth, Steph&#x2019;s younger brother, told ESPN. &#x201c;They broke it down to the point where he couldn&#x2019;t even shoot at all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had to do rep after rep after rep to the point where he was able to master it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was a tough summer for him,&#x201d; Dell agrees.<br><br>Steph worked with his father on changing his release point and moving the ball above his head in order to make his shots harder for rivals to block. Steph wasn&#x2019;t very muscular, so it was hard making the transition. But eventually the lessons kicked in, and he began to master the above-the-head shot.<br><br>As they practiced, Dell and Steph developed a unique approach that made his shot both quick and accurate. When most players learn to shoot, they&#x2019;re taught to release the ball as they reach the highest point of their jump. But Steph was learning to shoot on the way up, when he wasn&#x2019;t very far off the ground. By shooting as he was jumping, rather than at the top of his jump like most people did, Steph could release the ball lightning-quick, in as little as 0.3 seconds. That quick-shot technique would give him an advantage over defenders the rest of his life.<br><br>Shooting on the way up rather than at the top of his jump also enabled Steph&#x2019;s shot to take the form of a sharp arc, like a rainbow, making it much easier to swish through the net. Unlike everyone else, Steph&#x2019;s shots came in on a high angle, as if they were on a steep, downward slope to the opening of the basket. It was a distinctive approach he has maintained, more or less the same, throughout his playing career, according to the Wall Street Journal.<br><br>Back at school for his junior year, Steph&#x2019;s hard work began to pay off. That year, he averaged nearly twenty points a game. It also helped that he had a late growth spurt. By the time he graduated high school, Steph was six feet tall and weighed 160 pounds. He&#x2019;d grown half a foot and gained thirty-five pounds in two years. Steph led his team to three conference titles and three play-off appearances and was named an all-state and all-conference player his senior year.<br><br>Steph seemed on the road to greatness and began envisioning himself playing for a nearby college power. &#x201c;Growing up in Tar Heel country, you want to play for Duke, NC State, Carolina, Wake Forest,&#x201d; Steph says.<br><br>Yet none of those famed schools had any interest in Steph. Recruiters thought he was too small and thin to excel at the collegiate level. Steph was developing a sweet stroke from the outside, but he just didn&#x2019;t seem like someone who could create his own shots, deal with bigger defenders in his face, and play in college, at least at the Division I level. Some overlooked high school players excel in Amateur Athletic Union leagues, gaining the attention of colleges through that route, but Steph wasn&#x2019;t an AAU star, either.<br><br>While most of the biggest schools had little interest in Steph, it made sense that his father&#x2019;s alma mater, Virginia Tech, might be willing to offer him a spot on their team. Dell had been one of the school&#x2019;s greatest basketball players after all. And Virginia Tech doesn&#x2019;t usually go deep in NCAA tournaments, so the school often recruits high school players like Steph&#x2014;capable and hardworking but with little chance of becoming NBA stars.<br><br>But even Virginia Tech, which plays in the competitive Atlantic Coast Conference, decided Steph didn&#x2019;t deserve a scholarship. The only way he could play on their team, the school&#x2019;s recruiters said, was if he &#x201c;walked on,&#x201d; or tried out and outplayed someone else to earn a place on the team. They weren&#x2019;t going to guarantee a spot for Steph and wouldn&#x2019;t offer him a scholarship, no matter what his father had done at the school.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he ever said it,&#x201d; Seth says. &#x201c;But you could tell it hurt him.&#x201d;<br><br>Steph was disappointed, though he tried not to get discouraged, hoping a small school might give him a chance. That summer, Steph focused on refining his game and improving his shot, using the brush-offs as motivation.<br><br><i>The right college and coach will come,</i> he told himself.<br><br>Steph needed someone to believe in him. He found that person in Bob McKillop, the coach of Davidson College, a tiny liberal arts school located twenty minutes north of Curry&#x2019;s home. Coach McKillop knew all the famous universities had passed on Steph, but he had a feeling they were making a big mistake.<br><br>Yet like other coaches and recruiters, Coach McKillop saw the deficiencies in Steph&#x2019;s game.<br><br>&#x201c;He looked thin, frail, and not strong,&#x201d; Coach McKillop says.<br><br>The coach knew something others didn&#x2019;t, though. His son had played Little League baseball with&nbsp;Steph as a ten-year-old, and Coach McKillop got to know Steph, watching him on the field, game after game. He continued to follow Steph closely in high school and knew Steph had special talent.<br><br>That&#x2019;s not what convinced him that Steph could be a star at Davidson, though.<br><br>&#x201c;You could see the character, the poise, the work ethic, toughness, and resiliency,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>Coach McKillop got in touch with Steph and tried to convince him to enroll at Davidson, offering him a full scholarship. Sure, Davidson was tiny, with fewer than two thousands students and an average class of just fifteen. The university was best known for its academics and hadn&#x2019;t won an NCAA tournament game since 1969, let alone any major tournament. But at Davidson, Coach McKillop insisted, Steph could be a difference maker, a player with immediate impact. Trust me and the program, the coach told Steph. Good things will happen, he assured Steph.<br><br>Steph believed in himself and was confident he could enroll in a more famous school and make the basketball team as a walk-on. But even if he managed to make a big-time college team, Steph knew he likely wouldn&#x2019;t get much playing time. Maybe a few minutes here or there in mop-up duty at the end of a blowout. Playing a minor role on a team wasn&#x2019;t what Steph was hoping for, however.<br><br>Coach McKillop was the first college coach to make Steph feel he was wanted and that he could excel in big-time basketball. With that in mind, Steph signed on to go to school at Davidson.<br><br>&#x201c;I could have walked on at an ACC school,&#x201d; Steph says. &#x201c;But I wanted the opportunity to play.&#x201d;<br><br>In his very first collegiate game, Steph got the start at shooting guard, a sign of the confidence Coach McKillop had in him.<br><br>It was a huge mistake.<br><br>The game was against favored Eastern Michigan on their campus, twenty minutes outside of Ann Arbor. Curry and his Davidson teammates fell behind early and trailed by sixteen points at halftime, an early destruction. By halftime, Steph had nine turnovers. He would finish with a humiliating thirteen turnovers in total.<br><br>In the first half, Steph seemed truly out of his league in Division I basketball, just like the college coaches had predicted. In one embarrassing play, Steph handled the ball in the backcourt with defenders swarming around him and lost his footing. Slipping and falling to the court awkwardly, Steph flung the ball to a teammate, only to see an opposing player step in and knock it away. The Eastern Michigan fans cheered wildly, celebrating the ugly mistake. Davidson fans cringed.<br><br>At halftime, even Steph&#x2019;s coach had second thoughts about him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m rethinking whether he belongs in the starting lineup,&#x201d; Coach McKillop remembers contemplating.<br><br>In spite of his reservations, Coach McKillop decided to leave Steph in for the second half, hoping he might settle down. Smart move. Almost immediately, Steph and his team began to rally. Instead of acting discouraged or scared after the awful first half, Steph called for the ball, camping out on the three-point line and begging teammates to feed him the rock. Steph began knocking down threes, one after another, becoming more confident with each bucket. He quieted the hostile crowd and led Davidson to an improbable comeback victory.<br><br>It was an early sign of Steph&#x2019;s self-assurance and tenacity.<br><br>The next night, against an even more imposing University of Michigan team, Steph really went off. He scored thirty-two points, dished out four assists and even snatched nine rebounds.<br><br>Steph finished his freshman year as the leading scorer in the Southern Conference, averaging 21.5 points per game, second in the nation among freshman, just behind University of Texas forward Kevin Durant, the future NBA superstar. Steph also broke the freshman season record for three-point field goals.<br><br>One day that year, Coach McKillop spotted Steph&#x2019;s parents in the airport and walked over, making a prediction: &#x201c;Your son will earn a lot of money playing this game one day.&#x201d;<br><br>Dell Curry was skeptical. A great college shooter is one thing. Making it at the pro level is a whole different ball game. Even though he&#x2019;d had a late growth spurt, Steph was still short and slight, especially compared with guys in the NBA. Guarding big, muscular players in the pros seemed improbable. As far as Dell was concerned, Steph&#x2019;s chances of succeeding in the NBA, or even getting drafted by a team, weren&#x2019;t very strong; Coach McKillop&#x2019;s prediction seemed foolish.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking, &#x2018;Yeah, maybe [he&#x2019;ll have a chance to play] overseas,&#x2019;&#x201d; Dell Curry says.<br><br>But Steph kept growing, reaching six foot three inches by his sophomore year in college. And he continued to perfect his shot. On March 21, 2008, Steph and Davidson played in the NCAA tournament. With his parents in the stands and a national audience glued to their television screens, Steph dropped an astounding forty points on Gonzaga University, shooting an astonishing eight for ten from the three-point range, leading Davidson to its first NCAA men&#x2019;s basketball tournament win since 1969. Two days later, Steph burned heavily favored Georgetown University, the nation&#x2019;s eighth-ranked team, for thirty points in another upset victory.<br><br>His parents watched from the stands, absolutely stunned. Steph was evolving from a good player into a great one before their eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you believe that?&#x201d; Dell asked his wife.<br><br>They were so shocked they drove home from the game in silence, Steph&#x2019;s mother, Sonya, recalls.<br><br>During that year&#x2019;s tournament, Steph became a household name around the country, becoming only the fourth player in history to average at least thirty points in his first four NCAA tournament games and leading Davidson to the Elite Eight, where the team lost to the top-seeded and eventual champion Kansas Jayhawks.<br><br>&#x201c;He changed from him being Dell&#x2019;s son to Dell being Steph&#x2019;s father,&#x201d; Seth says.<br><br>Steph&#x2019;s eye-turning performance on the national stage had transformed the way he was viewed in the basketball world and beyond. After the NCAA tournament ended, his parents saw up close how much Steph&#x2019;s life and career had transformed in just a few days. At a Charlotte home game, they watched as fans mobbed Steph, as if he was a rock star.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s how I knew things had changed,&#x201d; Sonya says.</p><h2>A Big Day for Baseball (Magic Tree House (R))</h2><p><b>Meet Jackie Robinson and solve a mystery in the #1 bestselling Magic Tree House chapter book series! </b><br> &nbsp;<br> PLAY BALL!

Jack sat on his front porch steps. His chin was cupped in his hands.&nbsp;<br> Annie came out the front door.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you want Mom to take us to the rec center now?&#x201d; she asked. It was the day for baseball tryouts.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve decided not to go,&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> Annie sat down next to him. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; she asked.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about last season&#x2019;s&nbsp;tryouts,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;I fell down when I swung the bat. Everybody laughed.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, well, everybody laughed at me, too,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;Remember, I threw the ball to the wrong team.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So maybe neither of us should go,&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But our whole family <i>loves </i>baseball,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;We read about it. We watch it. We learn batting averages. We&#x2014;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> Before Annie could finish, something dropped from the sky and rolled across their front yard.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; said Jack. He and Annie ran down the steps.&nbsp;<br> A small white ball lay in the grass. Annie grabbed it.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a baseball!&#x201d; she said.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where did it come from?&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> He and Annie walked to the sidewalk and looked up and down their street. No one was there.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s from another world,&#x201d; whispered Annie. She handed the ball to Jack.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;What other world?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Think about it,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;One second, we&#x2019;re talking about baseball&#x2014;and how we don&#x2019;t want to go to tryouts. The next, this baseball drops from the sky!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh. You mean&#x2014;&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Morgan!&#x201d; Jack and Annie said together.&nbsp;<br> Annie took off down the sidewalk. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d; she called to Jack.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hold on!&#x201d; Jack shouted. He put the mysterious ball inside his backpack and raced after Annie.&nbsp;<br> Jack and Annie crossed the street and dashed into the Frog Creek woods. They hurried between the trees until they came to the tallest oak.&nbsp;<br> <i>The magic tree house was back.&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Yay, team!&#x201d; said Annie. She grabbed the rope ladder and climbed up. Jack followed her into the tree house.&nbsp;<br> Leaf shadows danced on the wooden floor. Two gray baseball caps sat in the dappled light.&nbsp;<br> Next to the caps was a book: history of baseball. A red leather bookmark was sticking out from the pages.&nbsp;<br> Jack picked up the book and opened to the bookmark. The page showed a photo of a baseball stadium. The caption beneath it said:&nbsp;<br> <b>Ebb</b>e<b>ts Fi</b>e<b>ld, </b>B<b>rooklyn, </b>Ne<b>w </b>Y<b>ork, April 15, 1947&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Ebbets Field?&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard of that. It was a famous ballpark.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Look, there&#x2019;s a message on the bookmark,&#x201d; said Annie.&nbsp;<br> Jack held the bookmark up to the light.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Morgan&#x2019;s handwriting!&#x201d; he said. He read aloud:&nbsp;<br> <i>&#x2019;Twas a big day for baseball&nbsp;</i><br> <i>So many years ago.&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Journey to Ebbets Field&nbsp;</i><br> <i>To learn what you should know.&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Learn what we should know?&#x201d; repeated Jack. &#x201c;To become better ballplayers?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sounds like it!&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;Morgan must have known about the tryouts.&#x201d; She read the next verse:&nbsp;<br> <i>These caps are magic&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Made only for you&nbsp;</i><br> <i>To give you the skill&nbsp;</i><br> <i>To know what to do.&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Oh, man, it sounds like these caps will make us great players!&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yay!&#x201d; said Annie.

He pulled the ball out of his pack and turned it over in his hands. &#x201c;No name here.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, maybe we&#x2019;re supposed to give it one,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;How about Ballee?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ballee?&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, okay. How about Fly Ball?&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;It flew down to us.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fine, whatever,&#x201d; said Jack.

He has received Theodor Seuss Geisel Honors for HI! FLY GUY and I SPY FLY GUY! Tedd lives with his wife, Carol, in upstate New York.Kirkus<br>The busy, buzzy beastie introduced in Hi! Fly Guy (2005) accompanies his best bud Buzz to school, and enters fly heaven. Which is to say, he discovers the lunchroom run by the esteemed Roz, a fine cook who isn't above rewarding a bug who can say her name with a delicious cup of chicken bones and fish heads in sour milk. But when Roz is fired in favor of Miss Muzzle whose idea of a nourishing lunch is burnt peas and turnips it's up to the resourceful Fly Guy to return the favor. Arnold's pop-eyed, big-headed cartoon figures provide the proper comedic air for this brief episode, which is arranged in chapters and wrapped in an eye-catching, glittery cover. Fledgling readers will cheer the intrepid insect on as he engineers Roz's return, and is last seen basking in a redolent bowl of garbage soup. Keep on buzzing, Fly Guy. (Easy reader. 6-8)<br><br>SLJ<br>K-Gr 2 In this easy chapter book, Buzz's pet fly attends school with him. When the lunch lady allows the insect to live in the lunchroom, she is fired. Fly Guy is subsequently banned from the room by her replacement, who is a terrible cook. Finally, Buzz comes up with a plan, Roz is reinstated, and Fly Guy gets to stay in the lunchroom. The writing is fast paced, the plot is interesting, and many of the humorous and mildly gross&#x201d; details will appeal to children. The cartoon illustrations are funny and action-packed and the layout is appropriate for beginning readers, with one or two sentences per page. The text has suitable repetitive phrases to aid the developing fluency of students beginning to read independently. It could also serve slightly older reluctant and struggling readers. Bobbee Pennington, Bryan Public Library, TX<br><br>BooklistArnold, Tedd. Super Fly Guy. 2006. 32p. illus. Scholastic, paper, $5.99 (0-439-63904-2).<br>K Gr. 3. There's definitely a buzz&#x201d; in the school lunchroom. It's Fly Guy, Buzz's pet fly. Fly Guy loves the dirty dishes, the smelly mop, and the garbage cans. When he meets Roz, the lunch lady, she pronounces, No flies in the lunchroom!&#x201d; Then Fly Guy endears himself to her by saying her name, Rozzz,&#x201d; and she feeds him treats (fish heads in sour milk). Sadly, Roz is fired after her boss demands that the lunchroom be fly-free. She is replaced by Miss Muzzle, who makes burnt peas and turnips. Everyone misses Roz, and Buzz makes a plan. After Fly Guy boinks Miss Muzzle on the nose, she tries to swat him and makes such a mess that she is fired, and Roz returns the next day. Arnold's golf ball eyed kids and fly are amusingly and comically exaggerated. Together with the zippy metallic cover and short, simple text, which is divided into three short chapters, they add up to a fly-by delight. Julie Cummins<br>Tedd Arnold Super Fly Guy; illus. by the author<br>32 pp. Cartwheel/Scholastic 3/06 ISBN 0-439-63904-2 $5.99<br>(Preschool, Primary)<br>How's this for a backstory? "A boy had a pet fly. The fly was named Fly Guy. Fly Guy could say the boy's name -- Buzz!" And, with that, Arnold zooms right into this sequel to the 2006 Geisel Honor Book Hi! Fly Guy. This time, Fly Guy and Buzz go to school, where Fly Guy shows off more of his genius by not only learning phonics (does, fuzz, and was) but also moving right up to the application level when he goes to the lunchroom and addresses Roz, the cook. Roz's small act of kindness (she lets Fly Guy eat chicken bones and fish heads in sour milk) is unrewarded when she's fired. But Fly Guy, with Buzz's help, gets his revenge (and more practice in phonics) by outwitting her replacement, Miss Muzzle, known in flyspeak as "Mizz Muzz." The cartoon illustrations of Fly Guy, with his, well, bug eyes, are a welcome departure from the sweet and fuzzy animals that populate so many beginning readers, and this manic story, told in three chapters with simple vocabulary and repetitive phrases, creates an energy for reading. Expect a lot of buzz over this one. B.</p><h2>PreTime Piano Disney: Primer Level</h2><p>(Faber Piano Adventures ).

Owing to his family s poor financial condition, Gibran did not receive any formal education in his childhood. He was taught at home by the visiting priests. Most of Gibran s early works were written in Arabic. His first work was a work about music. It was titled Nubthah fi Fan Al-Musiqa and was published in 1905. Ara is al-Muruj, his second work, was published the next year. It was translated as Nymphs of the Valley, Spirit Brides and also as Brides of the Prairie. Many of his works were written and published in English. These include The Madman (1918), Twenty Drawings (1919), The Forerunner (1920), The Prophet (1923), Sand and Foam (1926) and The Earth Gods (1931). With a strong element of mysticism, which is influenced by Islam, Christianity, theosophy and Judaism, his works deal with spiritual love, joy and sorrow, marriage, children and death. Gibran died from tuberculosis and liver cirrhosis on 10 April 1931 in New York.&#34;</p><h2>The Inspirational Leader: Inspire Your Team To Believe In The Impossible</h2><p>Can you inspire your team hearts and minds every day?

'Twas bigger than big!</i><br><br>No one loves Christmas more than Pig. And the world's greediest pug will stay up all night to get his presents! When Pig yips at Santa and finds himself joining in on the flying sleigh ride, things quickly get out of hand in a way that is pure Pig pandemonium.</p><p>Aaron Blabey has written many well-loved, bestselling books for children. He is the creator of three hugely successful series for children -- the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <b>The Bad Guys</b>, <b>Pig the Pug</b>, and <b>Thelma the Unicorn</b>. In 2018 it was announced that a movie adaptation of <b>The Bad Guys</b> is in development at DreamWorks Animation with Aaron serving as an executive producer on the project. Aaron's books have won many awards, including nine REAL Awards, an INDIE Book Award for Children's Book of the Year, a Children's Book Council of Australia -- Book of the Year Award, a NSW Premiers Literary Award for Children's Literature, two Australian Book Design Awards, and a Children's Peace Literature Award.K-Gr 3&#x2014;Pig, introduced in Pig the Pug, is back again in all his selfish splendor. Christmas is coming, and the greedy little pug expects Santa to deliver each item on his lengthy list. Unlike Trevor, a well-behaved dachshund, he refuses to go to sleep on Christmas Eve. He's wide awake when the "portly old gent" pays his visit and makes no bones about calling him out for the scanty pile of presents. "'Hey!' shouted Pig, sounding very unkind. Then he nipped poor old Santa's big, rosy behind!" Santa flees to his sleigh with Pig clamped on tight, and as the reindeer team speeds off, he falls away through the sky. He is saved from utter destruction, miraculously, as the text points out, by landing atop a Christmas tree topped by an angel. Though the ending is rather abrupt, the final glimpse of Pig with wings and a halo is hilariously ironic, since readers can be pretty sure he is unrepentant. VERDICT Clever rhymes and engaging illustrations combine to make this a fun way to convey the message that greed is bad. Highly recommended.&#x2014;Linda Israelson, Los Angeles Public Library</p><h2>Mom&#39;s One Line a Day: A Five-Year Memory Book</h2><p><b>A perfect baby shower, new mom, and first Mother's Day gift</b><br><br><b>Capture the everyday moments of motherhood with a quick and easy to maintain 5 year baby journal and memory book.</b><br><br><b>More than a daily diary or baby book:</b> Take away the guilt from not making that baby scrapbook with <em>Mom's One Line</em>, a Day 5 year journal and memory book.

He lives in Durham, North Carolina.The Power of Moments 1<p></p> Defining Moments<p></p> <br>1.<br> <br>Chris Barbic and Donald Kamentz were sitting at a pub in Houston, recuperating from another 14-hour day running their start-up charter school. They were drinking beer. Watching ESPN. And sharing a Tombstone pizza, the bar&#x2019;s only food offering. They had no idea, on that night in October 2000, that they were moments away from an epiphany that would affect thousands of lives.<br> <br>ESPN was previewing the upcoming National Signing Day, the first day when graduating high school football players can sign a binding &#x201c;letter of intent&#x201d; to attend a particular college. For college football fans, it&#x2019;s a big day.<br> <br>Watching the exuberant coverage, something struck Kamentz. &#x201c;It blows my mind that we celebrate athletics this way, but we don&#x2019;t have anything that celebrates academics in the same way,&#x201d; he said. And the students at their school&#x2014;primarily kids from low-income Hispanic families&#x2014;deserved celebrating. Many of them would be the first in their families to graduate from high school.<br> <br>Barbic had founded a school to serve those students. He&#x2019;d grown disillusioned teaching sixth grade at a local elementary school. &#x201c;I saw way too many of my students head off to the local junior high excited about school and eager to pursue their dreams, only to return a few months later with that light in their eyes totally gone.&#x201d; They would come back to visit him, telling stories of gangs, drugs, pregnancies. It crushed him. He knew he had two choices: Quit teaching to spare himself. Or build the school that those students deserved. So in 1998, Barbic founded YES Prep. And Donald Kamentz was one of the first people he hired.<br> <br>In the pub that night, as they watched the Signing Day preview, they had a sudden inspiration: What if we created our own &#x201c;Signing Day,&#x201d; when our students would announce where they will attend college? The event would allow them to honor all graduating seniors, since it was a condition of graduation at YES Prep that every student apply and be accepted to college, even if they ultimately chose not to attend.<br> <br>Their excitement grew as they shaped the idea: They would call it Senior Signing Day, and for that one day, graduating seniors would be treated with the same hype and adulation as college athletes.<br> <br>About six months later, on April 30, 2001, they held the first Senior Signing Day. Roughly 450 people crammed into a community center next door to their campus: 17 graduating seniors and their families, along with every other student in the YES Prep system&#x2014;from juniors to sixth graders.<br> <br>Each of the seniors took the stage, announcing where he or she would be attending college in the fall: &#x201c;My name is Eddie Zapata, and in the fall, I will be attending Vanderbilt University!&#x201d; They would unveil a T-shirt or pennant with their chosen school&#x2019;s insignia. Many of the students kept their final school decision a secret from friends, so there was suspense in the air. After each announcement, the room erupted with cheers.<br> <br>Later, the students would sit at a table, with their families crowded around them, and sign letters of matriculation, confirming their enrollment in the fall. Barbic was struck by the emotion of the &#x201c;signing&#x201d; moment: &#x201c;It hits home&#x2014;the sacrifices that everybody had to make for their kids to get there. No one did it alone. There were lots of people involved.&#x201d; By the end of the ceremony, there were few dry eyes in the room.<br> <br>Senior Signing Day became the most important annual event for the YES Prep school network. For seniors, the event was a celebration, the capstone of their achievement. But it held a different kind of meaning for younger students. At the third Senior Signing Day, which had expanded into an auditorium at the University of Houston, there was a sixth grader in the audience named Mayra Valle. It was her first Signing Day experience, and it made a lasting impression. She remembers thinking, That could be me. No one in my family has ever gone to college. I want to be on that stage.<br> <br>By 2010, six years later, the senior class had grown to 126 graduates, and Signing Day had expanded so much that it had moved to the basketball arena at Rice University, in front of 5,000 people. 90% of the graduates that year were the first members of their families to go to college.<br> <br>The keynote speaker, U.S. secretary of education Arne Duncan, was moved by what he saw. He scrapped his prepared remarks and spoke freely: &#x201c;No basketball game, no football game begins to compare to the magnitude and importance of what happened here today. . . . Thank you for inspiring not just your brothers and sisters, not just the underclassmen here, but the entire country.&#x201d;<br> <br>One of the graduating seniors was Mayra Valle. Six years after she imagined being on that stage, today was her day. &#x201c;Good afternoon, everybody, my name is Mayra Valle,&#x201d; she said, breaking into an enormous smile. &#x201c;And this fall I will be attending CONNECTICUT COLLEGE!&#x201d; The school was ranked one of the top 50 liberal arts colleges in the country.<br> <br>The crowd roared.<br> <br>2.<br> <br>We all have defining moments in our lives&#x2014;meaningful experiences that stand out in our memory. Many of them owe a great deal to chance: A lucky encounter with someone who becomes the love of your life. A new teacher who spots a talent you didn&#x2019;t know you had. A sudden loss that upends the certainties of your life. A realization that you don&#x2019;t want to spend one more day in your job. These moments seem to be the product of fate or luck or maybe a higher power&#x2019;s interventions. We can&#x2019;t control them.<br> <br>But is that true? Must our defining moments just happen to us?<br> <br>Senior Signing Day didn&#x2019;t just happen. Chris Barbic and Donald Kamentz set out to create a defining moment for their students. When Mayra Valle and hundreds of other YES Prep graduates walked onto that stage, they stepped into a carefully crafted defining moment that was no less special for having been planned. It&#x2019;s a moment they&#x2019;ll never forget.<br> <br>Defining moments shape our lives, but we don&#x2019;t have to wait for them to happen. We can be the authors of them. What if a teacher could design a lesson that students were still reflecting on years later? What if a manager knew exactly how to turn an employee&#x2019;s moment of failure into a moment of growth? What if you had a better sense of how to create lasting memories for your kids?<br> <br>In this book, we have two goals: First, we want to examine defining moments and identify the traits they have in common. What, specifically, makes a particular experience memorable and meaningful? Our research shows that defining moments share a set of common elements.<br> <br>Second, we want to show you how you can create defining moments by making use of those elements. Why would you want to create them? To enrich your life. To connect with others. To make memories. To improve the experience of customers or patients or employees.<br> <br>Our lives are measured in moments, and defining moments are the ones that endure in our memories. In the pages ahead, we&#x2019;ll show you how to make more of them.<br> <br>3.<br> <br>Why do we remember certain experiences and forget others? In the case of Signing Day, the answer is pretty clear: It&#x2019;s a celebration that is grand in scale and rich in emotion. No surprise that it&#x2019;s more memorable than a lesson on multiplying fractions. But for other experiences in life&#x2014;from vacations to work projects&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not as clear why we remember what we do.<br> <br>Psychologists have discovered some counterintuitive answers to this puzzle of memory. Let&#x2019;s say you take your family to Disney World. During your visit, we text you every hour, asking you to rate your experience at that moment on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is lousy and 10 is terrific. Let&#x2019;s assume we check in with you 6 times. Here&#x2019;s how your day shapes up:<br> <br>9 a.m.: Cattle-herding your kids out of the hotel room. There&#x2019;s excitement in the air. Rating: 6<br> <br>10 a.m.: Riding &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Small World&#x201d; together, with parents and children each under the impression that the other must be enjoying this. Rating: 5<br> <br>11 a.m.: Feeling a dopamine rush after riding the Space Mountain roller coaster. Your kids are begging to ride it again. Rating: 10<br> <br>Noon: Enjoying expensive park food with your kids, who might enjoy it less if they knew you bought it with their college fund. Rating: 7<br> <br>1 p.m.: Waiting in line, for 45 minutes now, in the 96-degree central Florida heat. Trying to keep your son from gnawing on the handrails. Rating: 3<br> <br>2 p.m.: Buying mouse-ear hats on the way out of the park. Your kids look so cute. Rating: 8<br> <br>To arrive at an overall summary of your day, we could simply average those ratings: 6.5. A pretty good day.<br> <br>Now, let&#x2019;s say we text you again, a few weeks later, and ask you to rate your overall Disney experience. A reasonable prediction of your answer would be 6.5, since it encompasses all the highs and lows of your day.<br> <br>But psychologists would say that&#x2019;s way off. They&#x2019;d predict that, looking back on the day at Disney, your overall rating would be a 9! That&#x2019;s because research has found that in recalling an experience, we ignore most of what happened and focus instead on a few particular moments. Specifically, two moments will stand out: riding Space Mountain and buying mouse-ear hats. To understand why those two moments matter more than the others, let&#x2019;s explore some of the underlying psychology.<br> <br>Consider an experiment in which participants were asked to undergo three painful trials. In the first, they submerged their hands for 60 seconds in buckets filled with frigid, 57-degree water. (Keep in mind that 57-degree water feels much colder than 57-degree air.)<br> <br>The second trial was similar, except that they kept their hands submerged for 90 seconds instead of 60, and during the final 30 seconds, the water warmed up to 59 degrees. That final half minute was still unpleasant, but noticeably less so for most participants. (Note that the researchers were monitoring the time carefully, but the participants were not told how much time had elapsed.)<br> <br>For their third painful experience, the participants were given a choice: Would you rather repeat the first trial or the second?<br> <br>This is an easy question: Both trials featured 60 seconds of identical pain, and the second trial added another 30 seconds of slightly reduced pain. So this is kind of like asking, Would you rather be slapped in the face for 60 seconds or 90?<br> <br>Nevertheless, 69% chose the longer trial.<br> <br>Psychologists have untangled the reasons for this puzzling result. When people assess an experience, they tend to forget or ignore its length&#x2014;a phenomenon called &#x201c;duration neglect.&#x201d; Instead, they seem to rate the experience based on two key moments: (1) the best or worst moment, known as the &#x201c;peak&#x201d;; and (2) the ending. Psychologists call it the &#x201c;peak-end rule.&#x201d;<br> <br>So in the participants&#x2019; memories, the difference between 60 and 90 seconds washed out. That&#x2019;s duration neglect. And what stood out for them was that the longer trial ended more comfortably than the shorter one. (Both trials, by the way, had a similar peak moment of pain: close to the 60-second mark.)<br> <br>This research explains why, in reflecting on your Disney experience, you&#x2019;ll remember Space Mountain (the peak) and the mouse ears (the end). Everything else will tend to fade. As a result, your memory of the day is far more favorable than the hour-by-hour ratings you provided.<br> <br>The peak-end rule holds true across many kinds of experiences. Most of the relevant studies tend to focus on short, laboratory-friendly experiences: watching film clips, enduring annoying sounds, etc. On longer time frames, peaks continue to matter but the relative importance of &#x201c;endings&#x201d; fades somewhat. Beginnings matter, too: When college alumni were asked about their memories from college, fully 40% of those memories came from the month of September! And beginnings and endings can blur&#x2014;if you change cities for a new job, is that an ending or a beginning or both? That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s preferable to talk about transitions, which encompass both endings and beginnings.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s indisputable is that when we assess our experiences, we don&#x2019;t average our minute-by-minute sensations. Rather, we tend to remember flagship moments: the peaks, the pits, and the transitions.<br> <br>This is a critical lesson for anyone in service businesses&#x2014;from restaurants to medical clinics to call centers to spas&#x2014;where success hinges on the customer experience. Consider the Magic Castle Hotel, which as of press time was one of the three top-rated hotels in Los Angeles, out of hundreds. It triumphed over competition like the Four Seasons Hotel at Beverly Hills and the Ritz-Carlton Los Angeles. Magic Castle&#x2019;s reviews are stunning: Out of more than 2,900 reviews on Trip-Advisor, over 93% of guests rate the hotel as either &#x201c;excellent&#x201d; or &#x201c;very good.&#x201d;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s something odd about the hotel&#x2019;s ranking, though: If you flipped through the photos of the resort online, you would never conclude, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of the best hotels in L.A.&#x201d; An interior courtyard features a pool that might qualify as Olympic size, if the Olympics were being held in your backyard. The rooms are dated, the furnishings are spare, and most walls are bare. In fact, even the word hotel seems like a stretch&#x2014;the Magic Castle is actually a converted two-story apartment complex from the 1950s, painted canary yellow.<br> <br>The point is not that it&#x2019;s a bad-looking place; it&#x2019;s fine. It looks like a respectable budget motel. But the Four Seasons it ain&#x2019;t. Nor is it particularly cheap&#x2014;the pricing is comparable to Hilton or Marriott hotels. How could it be one of the top-rated hotels in Los Angeles?<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s start with the cherry-red phone mounted to a wall near the pool. You pick it up and someone answers, &#x201c;Hello, Popsicle Hotline.&#x201d; You place an order, and minutes later, a staffer wearing white gloves delivers your cherry, orange, or grape Popsicles to you at poolside. On a silver tray. For free.<br> <br>Then there&#x2019;s the Snack Menu, a list of goodies&#x2014;ranging from Kit-Kats to root beer to Cheetos&#x2014;that can be ordered up at no cost. There&#x2019;s also a Board Game Menu and a DVD Menu, with all items loaned for free. Three times a week, magicians perform tricks at breakfast. Did we mention you can drop off unlimited loads of laundry for free washing? Your clothes are returned later in the day, wrapped in butcher paper and tied up with twine and a sprig of lavender. Which is much more pomp and ceremony than the doctor used when handing off your first child.<br> <br>The guest reviews for the Magic Castle Hotel are rapturous. What the Magic Castle has figured out is that, to please customers, you need not obsess over every detail. Customers will forgive small swimming pools and underwhelming room d�cor, as long as some moments are magical. The surprise about great service experiences is that they are mostly forgettable and occasionally remarkable.<br> <br>Now, when you phone the &#x201c;Popsicle Hotline,&#x201d; is that a defining moment? In the context of a lifetime, certainly not. (Hard to imagine a deathbed regret: &#x201c;If only I&#x2019;d chosen the grape . . .&#x201d;)<br> <br>But in the context of a vacation? Of course it&#x2019;s a defining moment. When tourists tell their friends about their vacation to Southern California, they&#x2019;ll say, &#x201c;We went to Disneyland, and we saw the Walk of Fame, and we stayed at this hotel, the Magic Castle, and you won&#x2019;t believe this, but there&#x2019;s a phone by the pool . . .&#x201d; The Popsicle Hotline is one of the moments that defines the trip.

Its profound principle about going the extra degree easily applies to the professional and personal parts of our lives. It spread through our organization in just weeks and has become part of the vernacular. When we talk about setting goals, we ask the question: Is it 211 or 212? -- --G. Fechter<br><br>My company provided us with this book in a recent training. Most of the training's are boring and something memorable for only a short time. This book is not that. The simple metaphor used in the introduction, and the entire basis of the book is very meaningful and easy to see in action. Today I hear so many people complain and feel that they are entitled to things instead of taking responsibility for their actions. This book shows that the smallest increment of effort can have positive effects not only on your professional life, but all aspects. This book uses real life examples that are easily relatable and prove the point. This is a quick read, but definitely worth the price and definitely applicable to life. I highly recommend this book. -- --Mark Trollinger</p><h2>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse [DVD]</h2><p>Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the creative minds behind The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street, bring their unique talents to a fresh vision of a different Spider-Man Universe, with a groundbreaking visual style that&#x2019;s the first of its kind.

Dav was so disruptive in class that his teachers made him sit out in the hall every day. Luckily, Dav loved to draw and make up stories, so he spent his time in the hallway creating his own original comic books. In the second grade, Dav Pilkey created a comic book about a superhero named Captain Underpants. His teacher ripped it up and told him he couldn&#x2019;t spend the rest of his life making silly books. Fortunately, Dav was not a very good listener. Dav has gone on to create award-winning and bestselling books for children.

(Who Was?)</h2><p><b><b>It's up, up, and away with the Tuskegee Airmen, a heroic group of African American military pilots who helped the United States win World War II</b>.</b><br><br>During World War II, black Americans were fighting for their country and for freedom in Europe, yet they had to endure a totally segregated military in the United States, where they weren't considered smart enough to become military pilots. After acquiring government funding for aviation training, civil rights activists were able to kickstart the first African American military flight program in the US at Tuskegee University in Alabama. While this book details thrilling flight missions and the grueling training sessions the Tuskegee Airmen underwent, it also shines a light on the lives of these brave men who helped pave the way for the integration of the US armed forces.</p><p>Sherri L. Smith is a children's book author, and this is her first book in the Who HQ series. She currently lives in Los Angeles, California.<br><br>Jake Murray is an Illustrator from Columbus, Ohio who specializes in sci-fi and fantasy art for the publishing, gaming, and advertising markets.<b>Who Were the Tuskegee Airmen?</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br> <b>January 20, 1945</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The plane was not going to make it back to the airfield in Italy. US Airman Larry Fleischer shivered inside the B-24 bomber as it limped through the skies.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> World War II had been raging for more than five years. In late 1941, the United States had joined with England, Canada, and other countries to defeat Nazi Germany and its allies.<br> &nbsp;<br> B-24s played a major role in winning the war. Fleischer&#x2019;s plane, however, had been hit while dropping bombs on a Nazi air base in Austria. Two of the engines were out. The bombing doors in the belly of the plane had jammed open. The wind was roaring in at sixty degrees below zero. Fleischer had already lost a boot trying to unstick the doors. Now, he was afraid he might lose his foot to frostbite. The plane needed to land soon. But where?<br> &nbsp;<br> Down below, the Italian coast was fast approaching. Fleischer and the rest of the crew scouted for a safe landing area. It was the copilot who found their best hope. He spotted an airfield, but it was one that didn&#x2019;t show up on any of their charts.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We really were expecting it to be a German field because why wouldn&#x2019;t it be on one of our maps?&#x201d; Fleischer recalled. If that were true, the pilot and crew would be taken as prisoners. But there was no other choice.<br> &nbsp;<br> The pilot carefully brought the plane in for a landing and saw that this was no German base. The runway was lined with American planes! Splashes of crimson paint marked these P-51 Mustangs as Red Tails. These fighter planes were famous for protecting American bombers in enemy skies. The Red Tails had saved Fleischer and his crew on more than one bombing mission. As another crewman put it, &#x201c;They were our lifesavers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Fleischer and his crew were so relieved! They went out to greet the approaching soldiers, eager to finally meet the Red Tails face-to-face instead of in the air. What they saw was the surprise of their lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;These are all black guys!&#x201d; Fleischer remembered thinking. &#x201c;It was a complete shock!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Why was it so surprising to see black pilots in 1945? Fleischer was a white guy from New York. His entire crew of ten men was white. The only black people Fleischer had ever seen in the army were cooks and waiters. Until now.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Red Tails weren&#x2019;t just any combat pilots. They were the famous Tuskegee (say: tus-KEE-gee) Airmen. They were the first airplane pilots of color ever in the US military. (<i>Military</i> means the armed forces of a nation.) But to Fleischer and his all-white crew, their existence was &#x201c;more secret than the atom bomb!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;Two Americas</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> By the end of 1939, World War II had broken out in Europe. The United States was not involved in the fighting yet. But the military wanted to be prepared, just in case. So the army had started the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) at many colleges and universities. (Civilians are people who are not in the armed forces.) The CPTP was created to teach young Americans how to fly planes. If the country joined the war overseas, there would be more pilots ready for battle.<br> &nbsp;<br> But not everyone could join the CPTP. It was for white people only.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> A 1925 military report said that black men were not as smart or as brave as white men. The belief was that black people couldn&#x2019;t learn how to fly airplanes. But that was completely wrong!<br> &nbsp;<br> Black people had been flying since 1917. An African American pilot named Eugene Bullard joined the French air force and fought against Germany in World War I. He won several medals for his bravery.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1920, a southern woman named Bessie Coleman went to France to learn how to fly. She became the first African American female pilot in 1921. Coleman returned to the United States, where she gave lectures and flew in air shows across the country. She wanted to raise enough money to start a flying school for African Americans. Unfortunately, in 1926 she was killed in a tragic airplane accident before that dream was achieved. Three years later, the Bessie Coleman Aero Club was founded in Los Angeles in her honor.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In May 1939, two black men named Chauncey Spencer and Dale White flew an old airplane from Chicago to Washington, DC. They wanted to encourage other black people to become pilots.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Washington, they met with a senator named Harry S. Truman. (Truman would become president of the United States in 1945.) Truman saw the rickety old airplane the men had flown. He said, &#x201c;If you guys had the guts to fly that thing from Chicago, I&#x2019;ve got the guts enough to do all I can to help you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Harry S. Truman was true to his word. Later that year, Congress approved six Civilian Pilot Training Programs for black people. The most famous of these programs was at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama.</p><h2>Plants vs. Zombies Volume 1: Lawnmageddon</h2><p>The confusing-yet-brilliant inventor known only as Crazy Dave helps his niece, Patrice, and young adventurer Nate Timely fend off a "fun-dead" neighborhood invasion in <i>Plants vs. Zombies: Lawnmageddon</i>!

The Yellow Brick Road in <i>The Wizard of Oz </i>must have suddenly made a lot more sense to those who&#x2019;d only seen it on black-and-white TVs prior! Maybe those viewers felt a little like I did when I got my first set of markers. I felt as though some wizard had just given me a whole rainbow with which to color magical worlds in whatever way I wanted. For a time, life was grand, right up until I learned about the so-called <i>rules</i>. Rules can sometimes be rigid and confining, and have a &#x201c;delightful&#x201d; habit of taking the wind out of your creative sails.&nbsp;<br><br>The first real rule I was taught as a child was <i>Color inside the lines</i>. Along with being the first rule I learned, it was also the first one that I simply <i>had to </i>break. I was much more interested in watching colors appear on the paper as I scribbled willy-nilly. It was hypnotizing. My young, little brain was thinking way too fast for my tiny hands to keep up. <i>Get the color on the paper </i>was the only goal I had in mind. I was a creative kid and my coloring was in abstract overdrive. I would go wildly outside the lines, straight over the lines, and, occasionally, right off the page and entirely onto the table! New rule from Mom: <i>Don&#x2019;t color the table</i>. (Some rules are just no fun at all.)&nbsp;<br><b><br></b>Now that I&#x2019;m <i>mostly </i>grown up I&#x2019;ve finally created a coloring book, not only for kids but also for the inner child in everyone. Nothing in the world makes me feel more like a kid again than the smell of a pack of crayons and a big blank coloring book full of possibilities.&nbsp;<br><br>In this collection, I hope to provide you with a really interesting and unique experience. I want whomever picks up this book and flips through its pages to feel an irresistible urge to fill in all its images with all sorts of vivid colors. You&#x2019;ll be surprised by how my pieces have changed for this coloring book. I have repurposed some of my artwork, adding cool patterned backgrounds to fill the negative space&#x2014;and to give you more elements to color. Ha! Ha!&nbsp;<b><br></b><br>Feel free to be as creative as you want! Color as you will. Break the rules if it pleases you. (But you don&#x2019;t have to be messy, if you don&#x2019;t want to be either.) This is a rule-free book.&nbsp;<br><br>Alternatively, you can use these pages to practice and to level up your coloring skills. Maybe your pencil sketches are great but you just haven&#x2019;t found your color style yet. Coloring isn&#x2019;t easy. And, no, I have never colored any of these images here. You will be a coloring pioneer!&nbsp;<br><br>Honestly, I struggle the most with choosing colors, more than with any other part of my creative process. Even when I spend all day choosing the colors, I sometimes just end up painting over them the next day anyways. Phew! Even writing about it is exhausting. Just remember you can always try again. You could even photocopy some&nbsp;of the images and practice on the copies before you give it a real shot in the book itself! That&#x2019;s what coloring is all about&#x2014;trial and error.&nbsp;<br><br>There is still a rebellious little child running around in my wild imagination, bending and breaking the rules of art as she pleases. My artwork blends the cute, creepy, and the surreal in a whimsical way that defies any logic or physics. I can&#x2019;t wait to see what inspiration you take out of the characters and patterns created for these pages. Go wild with your choices, be a rebel, think outside the box, and definitely, absolutely, color outside the lines and straight onto the table&#x2014;if that&#x2019;s what you want to do! Just don&#x2019;t tell your parents that I told you so. (Wink.

Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>For almost fifty years, Anne Frank&#39;s diary has moved millions with its testament to the human spirit&#39;s indestructibility, but readers have never seen the full text of this beloved book--until now. This new translation, performed by Winona Ryder, restores nearly one third of Anne&#39;s entries excised by her father in previous editions, revealing her burgeoning sexuality, her stormy relationship with her mother, and more.</p><h2>Rick Steves Florence &amp; Tuscany (Rick Steves Travel Guide)</h2><p><b>Walk in the footsteps of the Medici, sip <i>aperitivi</i>, and discover the cultural heart of Italy: with Rick Steves, Tuscany is yours to discover.

(What Was?)</h2><p><b><b>Find out all about NASA in this out-of-this-world addition to the What Was? series. </b></b><br><br>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, better known as NASA, began in 1958. With its creation, the United States hoped to ensure it won the space race against the Soviet Union. Author Sarah Fabiny describes the origins of NASA, the launching of the Apollo program that landed the first human on the moon, and the many missions and discoveries that have taken place since then. NASA has a rich history and still plays an important role in uncovering the mysteries of the universe. Readers are sure to get sucked into this book.</p><p>Sarah Fabiny has written several <i>Who Was?</i> titles, including biographies of Beatrix Potter, Frida Kahlo, Rachel Carson, and Gloria Steinem.What Is NASA?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On September 12, 1962, President John F. Kennedy stepped up to a podium at Rice University in Houston, Texas. It was a warm, sunny day. More than forty thousand people, many of them schoolchildren, were in the stadium to hear the president.<br> &nbsp;<br> About halfway through the speech, President Kennedy made a bold statement. He announced, &#x201c;We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Five years earlier, Kennedy and the country had watched the Soviet Union launch the first man-made satellite into space. (A satellite is an object&#x2014;either natural, like the moon, or man-made&#x2014;that revolves around a larger object in space.) In April of 1961, they had watched their Cold War enemy put a man in space. In 1962, the United States was losing the space race, and losing badly. The president knew that the space race would continue and that the United States had to be in it. And not just be in it, but win it.<br> &nbsp;<br> President Kennedy&#x2019;s words got the country excited. The United States was going to send a man to the moon. It was going to win the space race. It would be a big and important job to accomplish this. And that job would be up to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x2014;NASA.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tragically, President Kennedy would not live to see his dream of putting a man on the moon fulfilled. A little over a year after he gave his speech at Rice University, he was assassinated. But the country and NASA did not give up on President Kennedy&#x2019;s dream. The United States would be the first country to put a man on the moon.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> Chapter 1: Looking to the Stars<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> From the earliest times, people have looked up at the sky and imagined what was there. They dreamed of traveling into space and exploring what was beyond Earth. The stars and planets in the nighttime sky captured humans&#x2019; imaginations. But how would human beings ever be able to travel up and out of Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere? (Outer space begins about sixty-two miles above Earth&#x2019;s surface.) How could we ever explore the moon, the planets, our solar system, our galaxy, and what lies beyond even that? These were questions that scientists, philosophers, and astronomers asked for hundreds of years.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the end of the nineteenth century, some engineers and mathematicians in Russia and Germany had come up with ideas about how space travel might be possible. Rockets would be needed to launch anything&#x2014;or anyone&#x2014;into space. The engineers and mathematicians proposed that rockets could break the pull of Earth&#x2019;s gravity and take humans to outer space.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the 1880s, a Russian man named Konstantin Tsiolkovsky developed the basic theory of rocket propulsion. He figured out how much fuel a rocket would need and how fast it would have to go to get into space. In the United States, an inventor named Robert Goddard was also working on launching rockets into space. But he did more than just make calculations.<br> &nbsp;<br> On March 16, 1926, Goddard launched the first-ever liquid-fuel rocket. The rocket flew to a height of forty-one feet and the flight lasted two and a half seconds. While that might not seem like a big deal today, at the time it was a huge achievement. The United States government was not really interested in developing Goddard&#x2019;s ideas. However, scientists, engineers, physicists, and mathematicians in other countries continued to experiment with rockets.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Germans took Goddard&#x2019;s ideas and created their own rocket program. The man in charge of the engineering program was named Wernher von Braun. During World War II, von Braun and his team designed rockets that could carry bombs. More than 1,300 of these rockets were fired against Britain during the war.<br> &nbsp;<br> When World War II ended, the US Army captured a large number of German rocket parts found in a factory. The rocket equipment was brought back to the United States to be studied. Some of the scientists who had developed the rockets, including Wernher von Braun, came to the United States as well. The military knew that the rockets had been used as weapons. But they also realized that these powerful rockets could help with the study of the upper layers of the atmosphere and what lies beyond them.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the 1940s and 1950s, scientists and engineers continued to test rockets. At this time, the unmanned rockets were just being shot up into the air and coming right back down. But some of the scientists and engineers were interested in getting a rocket to orbit&#x2014;or go around&#x2014;Earth itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> The United States was sure that it would be the first nation to do this. But Americans were shocked when the Soviet Union announced on October 4, 1957, that it had launched the first human-made satellite into orbit around Earth. The United States&#x2019; Cold War rival had beat them into space. The space race was on.</p><h2>The Prayer of Jabez: Breaking Through to the Blessed Life (Breakthrough Series)</h2><p><b>Simple Prayer, Dramatic Life-Change</b> <br><br>It&#x2019;s a timeless prayer that produces timely results!

It was my senior year of seminary in Dallas. Darlene, my wife, and I were finding ourselves spending more and more time thinking and praying about what would come next. Where should I throw my energy, passion, and training? What did God want for us as a couple? I stood in our kitchen thinking again about a challenge I'd heard from the seminary chaplain, Dr. Richard Seume. "Want a bigger vision for your life?" he had asked earlier that week. "Sign up to be a gimper for God."<br>&nbsp;<br>A gimper, as Seume explained it, was someone who always does a little more than what's required or expected. In the furniture business, for example, gimping is putting the finishing touches on the upholstery, patiently applying the ornamental extras that are a mark of quality and value.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Seume took as his text the briefest of Bible biographies: "Now Jabez was more honorable than his brothers" (1 Chronicles 4:9). Jabez wanted to be more and do more for God, and&#x2014;as we discover by the end of verse 10&#x2014;God granted him his request.<br>&nbsp;<br>End of verse. End of Bible story.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lord, I think I want to be a gimper for You, I prayed as I looked out the window at the blustery spring rain. But I was puzzled. What exactly did Jabez do to rise above the rest? Why did God answer his prayer? I wondered. For that matter, why did God even include Jabez's miniprofile in the Bible? <br>&nbsp;<br>Maybe it was the raindrops running down the windowpanes. Suddenly my thoughts ran past verse 9.<br>&nbsp;<br>I picked up my Bible and read verse 10&#x2014;the prayer of Jabez. Something in his prayer would explain the mystery. It had to. Pulling a chair up to the yellow counter, I bent over my Bible, and reading the prayer over and over, I searched with all my heart for the<br>future God had for someone as ordinary as I.<br>&nbsp;<br>The next morning, I prayed Jabez's prayer word for word.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the next.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the next.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thirty years later, I haven't stopped.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you were to ask me what sentence&#x2014;other than my prayer for salvation&#x2014;has revolutionized my life and ministry the most, I would tell you that it was the<br>cry of a gimper named Jabez, who is still remembered not for what he did, but for what he prayed&#x2014;and for what happened next.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the pages of this little book, I want to introduce you to the amazing truths in Jabez's prayer for blessing and prepare you to expect God's astounding answers to it as a regular part of your life experience.<br>&nbsp;<br>How do I know that it will significantly impact you? Because of my experience and the testimony of hundreds of others around the world with whom I've shared these principles. Because, even more importantly, the Jabez prayer distills God's powerful will for your future. Finally, because it reveals that your Father longs to give you so much more than you may have ever thought to ask for.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just ask the man who had no future.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE PRODIGY OF THE GENEALOGY<br>Someone once said there is really very little difference between people&#x2014;but that little difference makes a great deal of difference. Jabez doesn't stand astride the Old Testament like a Moses or a David or light up the book of Acts like those early Christians who turned the world upside down. But one thing is sure: The little difference in his life<br>made all the difference.<br>&nbsp;<br>You could think of him as the Prodigy of the Genealogy, or maybe the Bible's Little Big Man. You'll find him hiding in the least read section of one of the least-read books of the Bible.<br>&nbsp;<br>The first nine chapters of 1 Chronicles are taken up with the official family tree of the Hebrew tribes, beginning with Adam and proceeding through thou-sands of years to Israel's return from captivity. Talk about boring! The long lists of unfamiliar and difficult names&#x2014;more than five hundred of them&#x2014;are likely to make even the bravest Bible student turn back.<br>&nbsp;<br>Take chapter 4. The descendants of Judah: Perez, Hezron, and Carmi, and Hur, and Shobal.... And that's just the beginning.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ahumai<br>Ishma<br>Idbash<br>Hazelelponi<br>Anub...<br>&nbsp;<br>I'd forgive you if you suddenly considered putting this little book aside and reaching for your TV remote. But stay with me. Because forty-four names into the chapter, a story suddenly breaks through:<br>&nbsp;<br>Now Jabez was more honorable than his brothers, and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, "Because I bore him in pain." And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, "Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain!" So God granted<br>him what he requested. (1 Chronicles 4:9&#x2013;10)<br>&nbsp;<br>In the next verse, the roll call for the tribe of Judah picks up as if nothing has happened&#x2014;Chelub, Shuah, Mehir....<br>&nbsp;<br>Something about this man Jabez had caused the historian to pause in middrone, clear his<br>throat, and switch tactics. "Ah, wait a minute!" he seems to interject. "You just gotta know something about this guy named Jabez. He stands head and shoulders above the rest!"<br>&nbsp;<br>What was the secret to the enduring reputation of Jabez? You can search from front to back in your Bible, as I have, and you won't find any more information than we<br>have in these two brief verses:<br>&nbsp;<br>� Things started badly for a person no one had ever heard of.<br>&nbsp;<br>� He prayed an unusual, one-sentence prayer.<br>&nbsp;<br>� Things ended extraordinarily well.<br>&nbsp;<br>Clearly, the outcome can be traced to his prayer. Something about Jabez's simple, direct request to God changed his life and left a permanent mark on the history books of Israel:<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory,<br>that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil.<br>&nbsp;<br>At first glance, the four requests may strike you as sincere, sensible, even noble, but not terribly remarkable. Yet just under the surface of each lies a giant paradigm breaker that runs exactly opposite to the way you and I usually think. In the pages to come, I want<br>to show you just how dramatically each of Jabez's requests can release something miraculous in your life.<br>&nbsp;<br>LIVING BEYOND THE LIMITS<br>When was the last time God worked through you in such a way that you knew beyond doubt that God had done it? In fact, when was the last time you saw miracles<br>happen on a regular basis in your life? If you're like most believers I've met, you wouldn't know how to ask for that kind of experience, or even if you should.<br>&nbsp;<br>What I have to share with you has been opening up lives to God's mighty working for many years. Recently, I was in Dallas to teach on the Jabez blessing to an audience of 9,000. Later over lunch, a man said to me, "Bruce, I heard you preach the message of Jabez fifteen years ago, and I haven't stopped praying it. The change has been so overwhelming I have just never stopped."<br>&nbsp;<br>Across the table, another friend agreed. He said he'd been praying Jabez's little prayer for ten years with similar results. The man next to him, a heart surgeon from Indianapolis, said he had been praying it for five.<br>&nbsp;<br>I told them, "Friends, I've been praying Jabez for more than half my life!"<br>&nbsp;<br>Because you're reading this book, I believe you share my desire to reach for a life that will be "more honorable" for God. Not that you wish others to reach for less, but for you, nothing but God's fullest blessing will do. When you stand before Him to give your accounting, your deepest longing is to hear, "Well done!"<br>&nbsp;<br>God really does have unclaimed blessings waiting for you, my friend. I know it sounds impossible&#x2014;even embarrassingly suspicious in our self-serving day. Yet that very exchange&#x2014;your want for God's plenty&#x2014;has been His loving will for your life from eternity past. And with a handful of core commitments on your part, you can proceed from this day forward with the confidence and expectation that your heavenly Father will<br>bring it to pass for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Think of it this way: Instead of standing near the river's edge, asking for a cup of water to get you through each day, you'll do something unthinkable&#x2014;you will take the little prayer with the giant prize and jump into the river! At that moment, you will begin to<br>let the loving currents of God's grace and power carry you along. God's great plan for you will surround you and sweep you forward into the profoundly important and satisfying life He has waiting.<br>&nbsp;<br>If that is what you want, keep reading.<br></p><h2>ESV Student Study Bible (TruTone, Chestnut)</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the ECPA Book of the Year Award for Bibles</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;<em>ESV Student Study Bible</em>&nbsp;is adapted from the&nbsp;<em>ESV Study Bible</em>&nbsp;and is&nbsp;ideally suited for students who are serious about God&#x2019;s Word&#x2015;who want to learn more about what the Bible teaches and how the Bible applies to all of life.&nbsp;</p><p>With 12,000 clear, concise study notes, the&nbsp;<em>ESV Student Study Bible</em>&nbsp;provides numerous other features&#x2015;including nearly 900 &#x201c;Did You Know?&#x201d; facts, 120 Bible character profiles, and&nbsp;10 topical articles.

May, M.D. (1940-2005), practiced medicine and psychiatry for twenty-five years before becoming a senior fellow in contemplative theology and psychology at the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation in Bethesda, Maryland. He was the author of many books and articles blending spirituality and psychology, including <em>Addiction and Grace</em>, <em>Care of Mind/Care of Spirit</em>, <em>Will and Spirit</em>, and <em>The Dark Night of the Soul</em>.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Psychiatrist May (1940&#x2013;2005), known for his works blending psychology and spirituality (<i>Addiction and Grace</i>), chose the theme and milieu of Nature for this, his last book. Chronicling outdoor forays he took from 1990 to 1995, May's elegant prose uses a storyteller's magic to plumb the profound mystery of outside events that provoke and foster inner change. Vivid details and masterful style place the reader in context: breathing alongside a bear, drumming with cicadas, grieving a man-mutilated turtle, dodging eagles or seeking fire's heat in a soaking storm. "Thunder came and it was my song, and the wind my courtesan, and praise welled up inside me as the rain poured, drenching down around and in and through me until the fire finally died under its flow and there was nothing but cold dark chilling water covering everything, running down my legs into rivulets." May is a kind of Christian Zen master, but this book doesn't favor a particular religious tradition so much as the deep wild of nature's way. In this work for everyone, he wants us to understand that wilderness is our natural state and that contemplative communion with the "Power of the Slowing" will bring us safely home to our wild eternal selves. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Most putting manuals focus on hard-set mechanics that even the top putters on Tour fail to achieve. According to Sieckmann, you can score even if your mechanics are flawed as long as you master four essential skills: 1) choosing the correct line; 2) starting your ball on that line; 3) matching the line with appropriate speed; and 4) believing completely in yourself and in your training. Borrowing from the same playbook he uses with his Tour clients, Sieckmann outlines a step-by-step process for perfecting these skills, which automatically boost performance.</p><p>For the past twenty years, <b>James Sieckmann </b>has honed his strategies and taught PGA and LPGA professionals at his school, the Shadow Ridge Golf Academy in Omaha, Nebraska.

Icy fingers of unease continually crept down her spine. There was no relaxing, not even with a drink in front of her and the pounding beat of the music calling.<br><br> "We know they followed us here, Genevieve," she whispered behind her hand. Whispering in the dance club with the music drumming out a wild rhythm wasn't easy, but she managed. They had accomplished what they set out to do, but now that they had drawn their three stalkers out into the open, what were they going to do?<br><br> "We must have been crazy thinking we could do this, Genevieve. Because we have no business exposing ourselves to this kind of danger." Mostly, Charlotte didn't think she should have exposed Genevieve to the danger. At least not when they were together. Not when they had a three-year-old to consider.<br><br> She did a slow perusal of the club, trying to take in every detail. The Palace was the hottest dance club in the city. Everyone who was anyone went there. In spite of the fact that it was four stories tall, every single floor was packed with bodies, as was the basement underground club. Men tried to catch her eye continually. She wasn't going to pretend she didn't know Genevieve was beautiful, or that she wasn't so hard on the eyes, either. The pair of them together drew attention everywhere they went-which was a bad thing.<br><br> "We're acting like normal women for a change," Genevieve said a little defiantly. "I'm tired of hiding. We needed to get out of the house. You needed to get out of the house. You work all the time. Honestly, Charlie, we're going to grow old hiding away. What good has it done us? We're not any closer to finding out who is doing this to us."<br><br> "I can't afford to be bait," Charlotte pointed out. "And I don't like you being bait, either. Certainly not both of us together when we have to look after Lourdes. She can't lose everyone in her life. It goes against everything in me to hide away, but I've got to consider what would happen to her if I was killed. They already murdered her father. She has no mother. I'm all she's got." When Genevieve sent her a look, she hastily amended, "We're all she's got."<br><br> Charlotte wasn't the hide-from-an-enemy type any more than Genevieve was. They'd met in France, both studying art. Genevieve painted, and she was good. More than good. Already her landscapes and portraits were beginning to be noticed, sought after by collectors. Charlotte restored old paintings as well as old carvings. Her specialty and greatest passion was restoring old carousels.<br><br> Genevieve was French. She was tall, with long, glossy dark hair and large green eyes. Not just green, but deep forest green. Startling green. She had the figure of a model and in fact had had several major agencies try to convince her to sign with them. She was independently wealthy, having received inheritances from her parents and both sets of grandparents.<br><br> Genevieve's maternal grandmother had raised her. A few months earlier, that grandmother, her last living relative, had been brutally murdered. A few weeks later a man Genevieve had been dating was murdered in the same way. His blood had been drained from his body, and his throat had been torn out. Charlotte's mentor, the man she was apprenticing under, was murdered a week after that.<br><br> Twice, when they were together, the two women had become aware of someone trying to enter their house late at night. They'd locked all the windows and doors, but whoever was after them had been persistent, rattling the glass, shaking the heavy doors, terrorizing them. The police had been called. Two officers were found dead in the courtyard, both with their blood drained and their throats torn out.<br><br> Charlotte received word a couple of weeks later that her only sibling, her brother, had been found dead, murdered in the same way. He was in California. In the United States. Far from France. Far from her. He left behind his business and his daughter, three-year-old Lourdes. Lourdes's mother had died in childbirth, leaving Charlotte's brother to raise her. Now it was up to Charlotte. Genevieve had decided to come with Charlotte to California. Whoever was after the two of them was in the States and Genevieve wanted to find them.<br><br> Genevieve laid her hand over Charlotte's. "I know Lourdes is your first priority. She's mine as well. She's a beautiful little girl and obviously traumatized by what she saw. Her nightmares wake me up and I'm not even in the same house."<br><br> Charlotte knew Genevieve wasn't exaggerating. Genevieve always knew whenever Lourdes had nightmares, even if she wasn't staying with them. At those times, she always called to make certain the child was all right. Lourdes had been present when her father was murdered. The killer had left the child alive and sitting beside her slain father. She'd been alone in the house with his body for several hours before she was found by her nanny, Grace Parducci, a woman who had gone to school with Charlotte.<br><br> "The police aren't any closer to solving the murders, Charlie. Not here and not in France. Lourdes is in danger just as much as we are. Maybe more." Genevieve leaned her chin on the heel of her hand as she hitched her chair closer to Charlotte's in order to be heard above the music. "I've been thinking a lot about this and how it all got started. What we did to draw some crazy person's attention."<br><br> Charlotte nodded. She'd been thinking about it as well. What else could she think about? Both of them had lost every family member with the exception of little Lourdes. Charlotte didn't want to lose her, and lately, in spite of taking every precaution, she hadn't felt safe. At. All. Grace had reported being followed and feeling as though someone was watching her as well.<br><br> Charlotte knew there was a part of her that had come with Genevieve to the nightclub in an effort to try to draw the murderer out. She'd certainly come prepared. She had weapons on her. Several. Most were unconventional, but she had them. She honestly didn't know if the people stalking them were the same ones who had murdered her brother, but it seemed likely.<br><br> Charlotte wasn't the type of woman to run from her enemies and it upset her to think her brother's murderer was going free-that he or she was trying to terrorize them. Not trying-she was terrified for Lourdes. She had no idea why the little girl had been left alive, but she wasn't taking any chances with her. Coming to the nightclub without her was a chance to draw the killer out without endangering her.<br><br> "That stupid psychic center we went to together for testing," Charlotte murmured. "It gave me the creeps."<br><br> Genevieve nodded. "Exactly. The Morrison Center. We went for a lark, but it wasn't the least bit fun. They got interested in us way too fast and kept asking very personal questions. When we left, I thought we were followed."<br><br> Charlotte had thought so as well. The testing site had been a little hole-in-the-wall, but in a high-traffic area, so neither had thought anything of it. They both often said they were psychic, and thought it would be so much fun to go in and test it, just like having their palms read. Something fun to do. It hadn't turned out to be very fun.<br><br> Charlotte looked into Genevieve's green eyes and saw the same pain she was feeling reflected there. Who knew that something they'd done on a whim would have such horrific consequences? It was like that with them. They both thought along the same lines, knew what the other was thinking.<br><br> "Ever since going there, I feel like we're being watched," Genevieve said. "And not in a good way. When we were still in France, before Grand-m re was murdered, a couple of men asked me out and I got this really creepy vibe from them. When they talked I just kept having the image of the testing center crop up in my mind and I couldn't help associating them with it."<br><br> Charlotte nodded her understanding. The same thing had happened to her more than once. And then the murders happened. Since then, they'd been much more careful. No dates. No fun. No strangers in their lives. Charlotte ran her brother's cabinetmaking business, and she did a little art restoration on the side, but she hadn't really been working at her own business for months. Not since she'd returned to the United States.<br><br> "What are we going to do, Charlie?" Genevieve asked. "I can't live like this for much longer. I know I should be grateful I'm alive, that we're alive, and I don't want to do anything that might endanger Lourdes, but I feel like I'm suffocating."<br><br> Charlotte knew how she felt. "We've taken the first step by coming here. We weren't all that quiet about it, either, Vi. We've attracted a lot of attention. Those men, the ones who keep asking us to dance-they give off that creepy testing vibe to me. What about you? And do they look familiar to you? I swear I've seen them before. I think in France."<br><br> Genevieve followed Charlotte's gaze to the three men who had continuously asked them to dance and sent drinks to their table. They'd winked and flirted and stayed close all night. They were good dancers; they'd asked other women and Charlotte had watched them. All three men knew what they were doing on the dance floor. All three were exceptionally good-looking. They seemed like men who frequented the dance club and picked up their share of women there. Still, there was something off about them.<br><br> "Same here. The one named Vince, Vince Tidwell, touches me with one finger every time he gets close enough. He just runs it over my skin. Instead of giving me any kind of cool shiver, it gives me the creeps, and the image of the testing center is right there in my mind. I keep telling myself we tested in France, so would they really follow us here? But I'm fairly certain they did."<br><br> "So maybe we should leave and then wait for them outside and try to follow them," Charlotte suggested. "Lourdes is safe for tonight. I've called half a dozen times, and Grace assures me all is quiet on the home front. We could track them tonight and find out where they're staying and who they really are. Maybe we'll find out what they want from us."<br><br> Genevieve's vivid green eyes lit up. "Absolutely. I need to do something to make me feel like I'm not sitting on my hands, just waiting for someone to murder me. I have to do something positive to help myself."<br><br> Charlotte nodded. She knew better. She had Lourdes. Responsibilities. One huge responsibility. She'd always been adventuresome. She pursued her dreams with wide-open arms, rushing headlong where others were afraid to go. She hadn't stayed home with her brother. She worked hard from the time she was very young so she could finance her trip to France, where she'd always wanted to go. She learned French early and worked hard at it until she could speak like a native. She'd left behind her brother and come back only to help him when his wife died. And then she'd left again.<br><br> "Selfish," she murmured aloud. "I've always been selfish, doing the things I wanted to do. I want to go after them, too, Vi. I swear I do." She had to put her mouth close to Genevieve's ear to be heard over the music. She wasn't the type of woman to hide in a house with the covers over her head, but what was the right thing to do? She honestly didn't know.<br><br> "Lourdes would be a lot safer if we figured this out, Charlie," Genevieve pointed out.<br><br> She wasn't saying anything Charlotte hadn't already told herself, but Charlotte still didn't know if she herself was making excuses to jump into action because she wanted to justify taking the fight and shoving it right down the throat of their enemy.<br><br> Charlotte made up her mind. She couldn't just keep hiding. It wasn't in her character and Genevieve was so right-Lourdes needed to settle into a normal life. They couldn't keep moving and trying to cover their tracks. "Let's do it, then, Vi. We can follow them and see if we can find out what they're up to. You can't look like you, though. You draw way too much attention."<br><br> Charlotte risked another quick glance at the three men. The one named Daniel Forester appeared to be the leader. His two friends definitely deferred to him. He was tall and good-looking and he knew it. He was staring at her even as he danced with another woman. The woman looked up at him with absolute worship, and he was ignoring her to stare at Charlie.<br><br> She raised an eyebrow at him to let him know she thought he was being rude. He grinned at her as if they shared a secret. "He is an arrogant prick," she hissed.<br><br> "So are his friends. Players. All three of them," Genevieve said. "They know they look good and they use their appearances to pick up women."<br><br> Charlotte couldn't help it; she laughed softly, breaking the stare with Daniel to regard her best friend. Genevieve was in full makeup and looked like a runway model. "Seriously? We're really getting bad here, Vi. We both know we look good and we came here hoping for a little fun."<br><br> "I don't know what you're talking about, Charlie," Genevieve protested haughtily. "I look like this all the time.

She lives on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, with her little cocker spaniel, Gracie.Not only the wind but the thunder and lightning send the boy and his dog scurrying for home, where Mudge whines as he circles the kitchen table and Henry whistles the same tunes over and over to keep up his courage. His parents, sipping tea in the middle, ``just looked at each other,'' while Dad creates a diversion: When the lights go out and Mudge hides his head in the couch, he suggests that Henry play the game of ``Crawling-Though-the-Enemy- Lines,'' braving the ``cannon'' he can hear as he makes his way through the dining room with a flashlight to rescue Mudge from the ``enemy couch.'' The 12th totally disarming picture of this nice family solving everyday problems with imagination and a sense of fun. And Stevenson's illustrations are as lively and comical as ever.

You will love this one, which is almost a whole unit on migration wrapped in a winning combination of easy verse, factual language, and beautiful illustrations. For animals, migration is a powerful compulsion, sometimes over long distances, often skipping meals. Sometimes, as in the case of the monarch butterfly, a round-trip takes several generations. Why do they do it? How do they succeed? The ten featured species offer a broad representation of migration: loggerhead turtles, monarch butterflies, manatees, ruby-throated hummingbirds, Pacific salmon, Canada geese, California gray whales, caribou, Arctic tern, and emperor penguin. The book is loaded with additional tips for teachers. Once again Marianne Berkes combines her teaching, writing, and theatrical skills to combine entertainment with education--creative non-fiction at its best.</p><p>A creative-nonfiction look at animal migration. Each spread focuses on one animal, describing both its journey and the reason behind it - the change of season, to give birth or to search for food and water. . . . The animals include a good mix of fauna from land, sea and air, and many will be familiar to readers. A final spread combines the migration routes of all the animals on a map focused on North America. DiRubbio s realistic artwork places each animal in its own environment, complete with the surrounding colors and flora. While highlighting the individual animal speaking in the verses, she also depicts whether the animal is usually a part of a herd or solitary. Extensive backmatter features more facts about migration, a paragraph of further information about each animal, some activity ideas from the author including another example of creative-nonfiction writing and a list of resources for learning more about the animals presented.

A solid introductory look at animal migration in a form that the youngest readers will appreciate. --Kirkus Reviews (April 2010)This introduction to animals&#x2019; migratory habits functions almost more as a comprehensive lesson plan than as a straightforward picture book. Poems written from the point of view of migrating animals themselves, accompanied by brief facts, are followed by extensive back matter including additional information about each of the animals, a map showing migratory paths, suggested books and Web sites, information about migration itself, and extended activities. Although much of the back matter will be of interest primarily to educators, the poetry and illustrations are child-friendly and should pique and hold young zoologists&#x2019; interest. The animals featured are ones that children know: turtles, monarch butterflies, and whales, among others. The poems feature accessible vocabulary and carry the theme &#x201c;Going home, going home&#x201d; throughout. Softly colored double-page spreads use a variety of perspectives to show the animals both close-up and in the context of their environments. Best for curricular use, in a school, classroom, or homeschool library.

While plants may temporarily steal the show, a low stonewall, solitary standing stone or dry stream remains unwavering through the years. Isamu Noguchi, the designer and artist, summed it up best,<b> "Any gardener will tell you that it is the rocks that make a garden. They call them the'bones' of the garden."</b><br><b></b><br>In The Spirit of Stone, award-winning landscape designer Jan Johnsen presents a richly photographed guide to the many creative ways that durable stone and gravel can be used in a garden. The chapters address rock gardens, walls, stone accents,walks and more. There is a chapter on sustainable stone that shows how to capitalize on stone's functional qualities in a beautiful way. And a last chapter highlights plants and stones together, natural companions in a garden.<br><br>The Spirit of Stone is an essential idea book for anyone looking to add dimension and resilience to their landscape - the tips and photos will inspire designers, homeowners, gardeners,and stonemasons alike.</p><p>If you are looking for inspiration for your own landscape, along with the background on the many ways to add stone, The Spirit of Stone is a great place to start.

Both the younger <em>and</em> older siblings of the family will enjoy this book. </strong></p><p>Having a little sister like four-year-old Ramona isn&#x2019;t always easy for Beezus Quimby. With a wild imagination, disregard for order, and an appetite for chaos, Ramona makes it hard for Beezus to be the responsible older sister she knows she ought to be...especially when Ramona threatens to ruin Beezus&#x2019;s birthday party. Will Beezus find the patience to handle her little sister before Ramona turns her big day into a complete disaster?&nbsp; </p><p>"An important reminder of the good that can come when you throw yourself fully into any situation and draw outside the lines," says Brightly.com in their article "12 Girls from Fiction Who Are&nbsp;Their Own Heroes."</p></p><p>Nine-year-old Beezus Quimby has her hands full with her little sister, Ramona. Sure, other people have little sisters that bother them sometimes, but is there anyone in the world like Ramona? Whether she's taking one bite out of every apple in a box or secretly inviting 15 other 4-year-olds to the house for a party, Ramona is always making trouble--and getting all the attention. Every big sister can relate to the trials and tribulations Beezus must endure. Old enough to be expected to take responsibility for her little sister, yet young enough to be mortified by every embarrassing plight the precocious preschooler gets them into, Beezus is constantly struggling with her mixed-up feelings about the exasperating Ramona. <p> There's no one in the world like Beverly Cleary, either. This terrifically popular author of over two dozen children's books has withstood the test of time for generations, as her many awards, including the Newbery Medal, attest. Two books in the Ramona series, <i>Ramona and Her Father</i> and <i>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</i>, were also named Newbery Honor Books. Louis Darling's wonderful ink illustrations are the kind that will stay with a reader for a lifetime. (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><p>Four-year-old Ramona Quimby has an imagination that often leads to unintended trouble. She mortifies older sister Beezus at the library; disrupts an entire art class; and one rainy day, invites all her neighborhood friends over for a party&#x2014;without even asking her mother. </p><p>Sometimes Beezus can be patient with Ramona. After all, they are sisters. But when Ramona almost ruins Beezus's birthday, it's the last straw. Beezus knows she ought to love Ramona&#x2014;but how can she get along with someone so exasperating? </p><p>In this tale of two sisters, Beverly Cleary writes with sympathy for Beezus and affection for Ramona. Newly illustrated by Jacqueline Rogers, <em>Beezus and Ramona</em> proves that the Quimby girls don't have to be alike in order to be unforgettable.</p></p><h2>The Art and Practice of Geomancy: Divination, Magic, and Earth Wisdom of the Renaissance (Art &amp; Practice Series)</h2><p>Have you ever lost an important object? Are you taking on a new job? Looking for buried treasure? The Art and Practice of Geomancy teaches readers how to divine the answers to life&#39;s everyday questions about health, luck, new jobs, and love, as well as those less mundane tasks such as finding buried treasure, predicting the weather, being released from prison, and identifying secret enemies. Greer delivers to readers an ancient system of divination in an easy-to-use form requiring little more than a pen and a piece of paper. Using a system of counting odd and even numbers--from a deck of cards, a roll of the dice, or even by hitting sand or dirt with a stick to generate patterns--readers learn how to cast their own geomantic chart. And for those who wish to delve further, he offers exercises for geomantic meditation and ritual magic. The Art and Practice of Geomancy will appeal to pagans, followers of the Western Mystery tradition, scholars of folk magic and divination, and anyone who wants to take their past, present, and future into their own hands.</p><p>The Art and Practice of Geomancy teaches readers how to divine the answers to life&#39;s everyday questions about health, luck, new jobs, and love, as well as those less mundane tasks such as finding buried treasure, predicting the weather, being released from prison, and identifying secret enemies.

Running from the accession of Louis XVI in 1774, it traces the history of France through revolution, terror, and counter-revolution to the final triumph of Napoleon in 1802. It also analyses the impact of events in France upon the rest of Europe and the world beyond. The study shows how a movement which began with optimism and general enthusiasm soon became a tragedy, not only for the ruling orders, but also for the millions of ordinary people whose lives were disrupted by religious upheaval, economic chaos, and civil and international war.<br><br>Now in its third edition, this volume has been fully updated in the light of current research, and includes an appendix surveying the past and present historiography of the revolutionary period.<br></p><p><br>Emeritus Professor of History and Senior Research Fellow at the University of Bristol, <strong>William Doyle</strong> was educated at Bridlington School and Oriel College Oxford. His postgraduate work culminated in a doctorate on Bordeaux in the Eighteenth Century, and he has since taught successively at the universities of York, Nottingham, and Bristol, with further visiting appointments in France and the USA. The author of sixteen books and co-editor of a further four, which include translations into eight foreign languages, Doyle is also the Co-founder of the Society for the Study of French History.<br>truly a master narrative of this classical subject of historiography. * Alexander Pinwinkler, University of Salzburg * . . . traditional, scholarly, narrative history . . . a clear and balanced picture of the origins of the Revolution. * New York Times Book Review * This is the most comprehensive all-in-one history of the Revolution . . . supremely clear and brimming with scholarly detail. * The Independent * His book is a tour de force of historical scholarship . . . and a pleasure to read. * Piers Brendon, The Mail on Sunday * For readers who need a fairly brisk, non-digressive account of events after the accession of Louis XVI up to Napoleon and the peace of Amiens in 1802, this compact book, by the professor and chairman of the school of history at Bristol University, is the answer. * Anthony Curtis, Financial Times * first-rate synthesis . . . The strengths of the book are its firm narrative thread, its measured tone and the extraordinary distillation of knowledge contained in each chapter. The author&#39;s familiarity with ongoing research in the field of French revolutionary history is nearly total; the fruits of many historians&#39; labours are deftly summarised, received opinions modified, alternative judgments formulated. In terms of sheer coverage, the book is difficult to fault. Not only is the life of revolutionary France captured in these pages, but that of much of Europe as well. * New Statesman * Doyle has produced a wonderfully lucid, authoritative, and balanced history, ornamented with all the scholarly apparatus one would expect from an Oxford history. * Linda Colley, London Review of Books * He writes lucidly and gracefully, with balance and good judgement . . . offers valuable insights into the shadows that the Revolution cast across the century that followed it. * Philip Zeigler, Weekend Telegraph * ... a work of breath-taking range which deserves to reach a wide popular market . . . It is the fullest history to appear of the Revolutionary era . . . Masterfully written, with a nice sense of the atmosphere and of the physical background to the events recounted. * Marianne Elliott, The Observer * Doyle&#39;s book, in its readability, its clarity, and its balance, is certainly the best of the general studies of the Revolution that have recently appeared; it will appeal both to the general reader and to the historian. And it deals with the subject, rather than with those who have already written about it. * Richard Griffiths, Times Higher Educational Supplement * Review from previous edition ... an outstanding model of clarity and informed scholarship. * Simon Schama, New Republic *</p><h2>We Are the Romani People</h2><p>Written by a Romani (Gypsy), this introduction to Roma life, health, food, culture, and society provides an insightful look at this despised by mysterious minority originating in India.

The Arabs wanted the Jews and British out of Iraq. The Mufti of Jerusalem forged a far-ranging alliance with Hitler resulting in the June 1941 Farhud, a Nazi-style pogrom in Baghdad that set the stage for the devastation and expulsion of the Iraqi Jews and ultimately almost a million Jews across the Arab world. The Farhud was the beginning of what became a broad Nazi-Arab alliance in the Holocaust.</p><p>Edwin Black is the award-winning, New York Times and international investigative author of 80 bestselling editions in 14 languages in 61 countries, as well as scores of newspaper and magazine articles in the leading publications of the United States, Europe and Israel.

He is generally considered the greatest American theologian. A prolific writer, Edwards is known for his many sermons, including "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God", and his classic<em>&nbsp;Treatise Concerning Religious Affections.</em>&nbsp;Edwards was appointed president of the College of New Jersey (later renamed Princeton University) shortly before his death.&nbsp;</p><p>theologian; author, <em>Treatise Concerning Religious Affections</em></p><p>&#x201c;I am thrilled that Kyle Strobel has edited this new edition of Edwards&#x2019;s <em>Charity and Its Fruits</em>. This series of sermons holds a special place in my affections for Edwards for three reasons. First, in Munich, Germany, my wife and I read it aloud to each other in 1972. What a way to build a young marriage! Second, Edwards&#x2019;s treatment of &#x2018;Charity seeketh not her own&#x2019; profoundly shaped my emerging Christian Hedonism. Third, the last chapter, &#x2018;Heaven Is a World of Love,&#x2019; is simply unsurpassed in its power to make me want to go there. I am unabashed in my love for Jonathan Edwards&#x2015;and the grandeur of his God. May God give him an ever-wider voice.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John Piper,</strong> Founder and Teacher, desiringGod.org; Chancellor, Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary; author, <em>Desiring God</em></p><p>&#x201c;This new edition of <em>Charity and Its Fruits</em> is a most welcomed addition to the growing library of books by and about the great Jonathan Edwards. For those who mistakenly think that Protestant theologians overemphasize faith at the expense of love, these classic sermons by Edwards will be an antidote to a stereotype. But even more important, this deep mining of 1 Corinthians 13 is a pathway into spiritual theology that will draw every believer closer to Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Timothy George,</strong>&nbsp;Founding Dean and Research Professor of Divinity, Beeson Divinity School, Samford University; general editor, Reformation Commentary on Scripture</p><p>&#x201c;For Jonathan Edwards, the true Puritan understanding of Christianity as love-life in God through Christ was a lifelong theological-pastoral-devotional focus, and his fullest display of it is found here.

Packer,</strong> Board of Governors' Professor of Theology, Regent College</p><p>&#x201c;As best I can tell, this is a first in Edwardsean studies. No one has done with <em>Charity and Its Fruits</em> what Kyle Strobel accomplishes here&#x2015;providing us with an enlightening commentary and a readable text of one of Edwards&#x2019;s most important, though highly neglected, treatises. All who love Edwards (and everyone should) will profit immensely from this exceptional volume.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sam Storms,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, Bridgeway Church, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</p><p>&#x201c;Jonathan Edwards is America&#x2019;s most famous theologian, and he is experiencing a resurrection among some evangelicals today. Not all who clap for Edwards have read him extensively, and for some the applause appears to be little more than groupthink. But this annotation of Edwards&#x2019;s seminal exposition of 1 Corinthians 13, edited by a competent young Edwards specialist who offers an informed introduction to Edwards&#x2019;s moral thought, holds promise for all of us to become more dedicated to the theological vision for the glory of God at work in the theology of Edwards. All who read Edwards aright know they are in for an experience of sensate knowledge, and not simply academic intelligence.

Again and again, she&#x2019;d lain there in the dark, covered in cold sweat and waiting for her heart to slow, relieved that Emma, lying beside her, hadn&#x2019;t woken, relieved that it had only been a dream.<br><br> Except it wasn&#x2019;t a dream; she knew that.<br><br> He&#x2019;ll come, Kate repeated. When he reads it, he&#x2019;ll come.<br><br> The day was hot and humid, and Kate wore a lightweight summer dress and a pair of patched leather sandals. Her hair was pulled back and cinched with a rubber band, though a few loose strands stuck to her face and neck. She was fifteen and taller than she&#x2019;d been a year ago. In other respects, her appearance hadn&#x2019;t changed. With her dark blond hair and hazel eyes, she still struck all who saw her as a remarkably pretty girl. But a person did not have to look closely to see the furrow of worry that was etched into her brow, or the tension that lived in her arms and shoulders, or the way her fingernails were bitten to the quick.<br><br> In that respect, truly, nothing had changed.<br><br> Kate had not moved from beside the tree, but stood there, absently fingering the gold locket that hung from her neck.<br><br> More than ten years earlier, Kate and her younger brother and sister had been sent away from their parents. They had grown up in a series of orphanages, a few that were nice and clean, run by kind men and women, but most of them not so nice, and the adults who ran them not so kind. The children had not been told why their parents had sent them away, or when they were coming back. But that their parents would eventually return, that they would all once more be a family, the children had never doubted.<br><br> It had been Kate&#x2019;s duty to look after her brother and sister. She had made that promise the night her mother had come into her room that Christmas Eve so long ago. She could picture it still: her mother leaning over her, fastening the golden locket around her small neck, as Kate promised that she would protect Michael and Emma and keep them safe.<br><br> And year after year, in orphanage after orphanage, even when they had faced dangers and enemies they could never have imagined, Kate had been true to her word.<br><br> But if Dr. Pym didn&#x2019;t come, how would she protect them now?<br><br> But he will come, she told herself. He hasn&#x2019;t abandoned us.<br><br> If that&#x2019;s so, said a voice in her head, why did he send you here?<br><br> And, unable to help herself, Kate turned and looked down the hill. There, visible through the trees, were the crumbling brick walls and turrets of the Edgar Allan Poe Home for Hopeless and Incorrigible Orphans.<br><br> In her defense, it was only when Kate was frustrated or tired that she questioned Dr. Pym&#x2019;s decision to send her and Michael and Emma back to Baltimore. She knew he hadn&#x2019;t really abandoned them. But the fact remained: of all the orphanages the children had lived in over the years--one of which had been next to a sewage treatment plant; another had made groaning noises and seemed to be always catching on fire--the Edgar Allan Poe Home for Hopeless and Incorrigible Orphans was the worst. The rooms were freezing in the winter, boiling in the summer; the water was brown and chunky; the floors squished and oozed; the ceilings leaked; it was home to warring gangs of feral cats. . . .<br><br> And as if that weren&#x2019;t enough, there was Miss Crumley, the lumpy-bodied, Kate-and-her-brother-and-sister-hating orphanage director. Miss Crumley had thought she&#x2019;d gotten rid of the children for good last Christmas, and she had been less than pleased to have them turn up on her doorstep a week later, bearing a note from Dr. Pym saying that the orphanage at Cambridge Falls had been closed due to &#x201c;an infestation of turtles,&#x201d; and would Miss Crumley mind watching the children till the problem was resolved.<br><br> Of course Miss Crumley had minded. But when she&#x2019;d attempted to call Dr. Pym to inform him that under no circumstances could she accept the children and that she was returning them on the next train, she&#x2019;d found that all the information Dr. Pym had previously given her (phone number for the orphanage, address and directions, testimonials from happy, well-fed children) had disappeared from her files. Nor did the phone company have any record of a number. In fact, no matter how much she dug, Miss Crumley was unable to find any evidence that the town of Cambridge Falls actually existed. In the end, she&#x2019;d been forced to give in. But she let the children know that they were unwelcome, and she took every opportunity to corner them in the hallways or the cafeteria, firing questions while poking them with her pudgy finger.<br><br> &#x201c;Where exactly is this Cambridge Falls?&#x201d;--poke--&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t I find it on any maps?&#x201d;--poke--&#x201c;Who is this Dr. Pym fellow?&#x201d;--poke, poke--&#x201c;Is he even a real doctor?&#x201d;--poke, poke, poke--&#x201c;What happened up there? I know something fishy&#x2019;s going on! Answer me!&#x201d;--poke, poke, poke, pinch, twist.<br><br> Frustrated at having had her hair pulled for the third time in one week, Emma had suggested that they tell Miss Crumley the truth: that Dr. Stanislaus Pym was a wizard, that the reason Miss Crumley couldn&#x2019;t find Cambridge Falls on a map was that it was part of the magical world and therefore hidden from normal (or in her case, subnormal) humans, that as far as what had happened there, the three of them had discovered an old book bound in green leather that had carried them back through time, that they&#x2019;d met dwarves and monsters, fought an evil witch, saved an entire town, and that pretty much any way you looked at it, they were heroes. Even Michael.<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Michael had said sarcastically.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Anyway, we can&#x2019;t say that. She&#x2019;ll think we&#x2019;re crazy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So what?&#x201d; Emma had replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather be in a loony bin than this place.&#x201d;<br><br> But in the end, Kate had made them stick to their story. Cambridge Falls was an ordinary sort of place, Dr. Pym was an ordinary sort of man, and nothing the least bit out of the ordinary had happened. &#x201c;We have to trust Dr. Pym.&#x201d;<br><br> After all, Kate thought, what other choice did they have?</p><h2>Being a Grandparent: Just Like Being a Parent ... Only Different</h2><p>Dr. Ray Guarendi believes that parenting is too important to be taken seriously&#x2014;and that goes double for grandparenting. As a father of ten, clinical psychologist, radio host and author of many books about marriage and parenting, Dr. Ray has spent his career helping to strengthen families through a combination of Catholic theology, common-sense insights and wry humor. Now, having become a new grandpa himself, Dr. Ray is turning his attention to the joyful, rejuvenating and sometimes complicated subject of grandparenting.<br><br> In <i>Being a Grandparent: Just Like Being a Parent...Only Different</i>, he answers real questions from grands. Some wonder how being a grandparent will differ from being a parent, and want to mature into it with as few wrinkles as possible. Some are a daily presence in their grandchildren&#x2019;s lives, perhaps even sharing a home with them and wanting their interactions to be as smooth as possible. Others live many miles away and fear yielding to the temptation of bribery to endear their distant grandbabies to them. Some are baffled as to why their own children are raising the grandkids so unlike they were raised&#x2014;in practice, discipline or morals. Others see their grandchildren as difficult to be around, and ask what, if anything, they can do about it.<br><br> Whether you&#x2019;re a &#x201c;Grandma,&#x201d; a &#x201c;Poppy,&#x201d; an &#x201c;Opa&#x201d; or a &#x201c;Nana,&#x201d; Dr. Ray can help you navigate this second go-round with children in a way that mirrors God&#x2019;s own unconditional love for us. You&#x2019;ll learn to balance the expertise you&#x2019;ve banked during decades as a parent with the emotional dynamics of this new stage of life. And best of all, you&#x2019;ll get a little extra insight into savoring the true, unabashed joy of grandparenthood.<br><br><i>Being a Grandparent </i>makes a great gift for new grandparents and seasoned matriarchs and patriarchs alike.&nbsp;<br><br><b>The audio edition of this book can be downloaded via Audible.</b></p><p>Dr. Ray Guarendi is a clinical psychologist, prolific author and speaker, and nationally syndicated radio host.

From the most basic topics to intricate ways of dealing with witnesses, this book will give your depositions focus and purpose. I highly recommend it.&#x201d;<br>---<em>The Wisconsin Lawyer</em><br>&#x201c;In every respect, D. Shane Read&#x2019;s book skillfully summarizes the art and science of taking depositions. [It] is an excellent resource for attorneys of all experience levels and areas of practice. <em>Winning at Deposition</em> is arranged in cogent chapters addressing everything . . . .

Begam, Past President, Association of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA)<br><br>&#x201c;I have been a trial lawyer for 50 years and have taken about as many depositions as any living lawyer and with as great a variety of witnesses as are involved in litigation. I find that Winning at Deposition is a superb reference for lawyers of all levels. Mr. Read&#x2019;s suggestions for difficult witnesses are amazing tools. The inclusion of portions of actual depositions of witnesses and parties from some of the most significant litigation in our lifetime is helpful beyond description. A copy of this book will remain in my library as long as I practice.&#x201d;<br><br>---Broadus A. Spivey, Past President of Texas Trial Lawyers Association<br><br>&#x201c;This is a much, much needed addition to lawyering skills literature. Winning at Deposition should help new lawyers and seasoned advocates alike significantly improve their deposition skills. The book makes excellent use of examples from high profile cases to illustrate what lawyers strategically should do in a deposition &#x2013; as opposed to simply telling them what can be done. Winning at Deposition encourages lawyers to conduct a purpose driven deposition, demonstrating quite effectively that more often than not, less is more. A terrific companion to Shane Read&#x2019;s Winning at Trial, the book includes great practice tips that very succinctly capture the explanatory text. This book should be on every litigator&#x2019;s shelf.&#x201d;<br><br>---Douglas A. Blaze, Dean and former Director of Clinical Programs University of Tennessee College of Law<br><br>&#x201c;Shane Read has a gift, as evidenced by his earlier Winning at Trial, to convey in an interesting and enjoyable style, all you ever wanted and needed to know about taking or defending a deposition. . . . One of the more important responsibilities of a General Counsel is to find the best litigator available when your client company is faced with a troubling lawsuit. You reassure your senior management and Board of Directors that you have selected expert, experienced outside counsel and all will be well. You then join your outside counsel in a key deposition and will likely either decide on the spot that he is all you hoped he would be or you wonder if he has ever taken a deposition before. I would strongly recommend to in-house and outside counsel that they read Winning at Deposition. It will likely come to be known as the bible for taking and defending a deposition. I can strongly encourage any lawyer who wishes to win at trial that he read this book.&#x201d; <br><br>---John J.

The CIA's Vienna station gathered intel during those tense hours, assimilating facts from the ground and from an agent on the inside. So when it all went wrong, the question had to be asked: Had their agent been compromised, and how?</p><p>Two of the CIA's case officers in Vienna, Henry Pelham and Celia Harrison, were lovers at the time, and on the night of the hostage crisis Celia decided she'd had enough. She left the agency, married and had children, and now lives in idyllic Carmel-by-the-Sea. Henry is still a case officer in Vienna, and has traveled to California to see her one more time, to relive the past, maybe, or to put it behind him once and for all.<br> But neither of them can forget that long-ago question: Had their agent been compromised? If so, how?

In Vienna during the mid-2000s Henry and Celia were intelligence agents and lovers who witnessed a terrorist hijacking as it took a shocking turn. Five years later, the two meet over dinner at a restaurant in Carmel-by-the-Sea where Celia now lives as a civilian, to recall the events of the past. As the remembrances overlap with the present moment, tension mounts and questions of who did what to whom, and why, become increasingly urgent. By the last 100 pages Steinhauer&#x2019;s hook is firmly embedded and it&#x2019;s hard not to race to the finish. And the ending?

Gilbert Shelton&#x2019;s comics and books have now sold over 40 million copies worldwide in 17 languages.</p><p>Born in Dallas in 1940, Gilbert Shelton&#x2019;s unlikely first venture into the world of comic art was doing strips for Boy Scout publications when he was in the Explorer Scouts at school. At university in Austin, Texas he became editor of the official student magazine, The Texas Ranger, for $100 an issue. This was to prove Shelton&#x2019;s last &#x2018;real job&#x2019;. For in 1968, after contributing to various underground comix with his earliest character, Wonder Wart-Hog, and designing posters for rock concerts, Shelton created The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. In 1969 Shelton and some friends from Texas moved to San Francisco to set up Rip Off Press from where Freak Brothers strips were soon syndicated, borrowed (or stolen!) by a host of American underground newspapers and magazines. The first collection was published in 1971 and has since been joined by thirteen further Freak Brothers adventures. Fat Freddy&#x2019;s Cat, the feline world&#x2019;s number one cat, started out as a footnote strip to the Freak Brothers but has led an independent &#x2013; and very successful &#x2013; life since 1975. In 1993 Shelton introduced new characters, Not Quite Dead, the world&#x2019;s least successful Rock Band who have since appeared in a series of comics of their own. Now over 50 years later and unlike many cults from the sixties which have since faded away, The Freak Brothers are still going from strength to strength and acquiring new fans all the time. They are published in 17 languages and worldwide sales are now over 40 million copies plus millions of items of merchandise, T-shirts, postcards, badges, posters and more. Shelton currently lives in Paris with his wife and three cats.&#x201c;Gilbert Shelton is as near as comics have come to producing a natural comedic genius&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;Alan Moore<br><br>&#x201c;Wonderful, wonderful stuff.

Currie&#39;s whole upbringing was immersed in the life of fundamentalist Protestantism - theology professors, seminary presidents and founders of evangelical mission agencies were frequent guests at his family dinner table. Currie received a degree from Trinity International University and studied in the Masters of Divinity program. This book was written as an explanation to his fundamentalist and evangelical friends and family about why he became a Roman Catholic. Currie presents a very lucid, systematic and intelligible account of the reasons for his conversion to the ancient Church that Christ founded. He gives a detailed discussion of the important theological and doctrinal beliefs Catholic and evangelicals hold in common, as well as the key doctrines that separate us, particularly the Eucharist, the Pope, and Mary.</p><p></p><h2>Vincent, Theo and the Fox: A mischievous adventure through the paintings of Vincent van Gogh</h2><p><p>An adventure story for children inspired and illustrated by the paintings of Vincent van Gogh.

The form in which he casts his work exercises a very powerful attraction on the reader. The fifteen books De Trinitate, on which he worked for fifteen years, from 400 to 416, are the most elaborate and profound work of St. Augustine.

The book emphasizes that these rights belong to every child on the planet, whether they are black or white, small or big, rich or poor, born here or somewhere else.&#x201d; It also makes evident that knowing and talking about these rights are the first steps toward making sure that they are respected.<br><br>A brief afterword explains that the rights outlined in the book come from the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989. The treaty sets out the basic human rights that belong to children all over the world, recognizing that children need special protection since they are more vulnerable than adults. It has been ratified by 193 countries, with the exception of Somalia and the United States. Once a country has ratified the document, they are legally bound to comply with it and to report on their efforts to do so. As a result, some progress has been made, not only in awareness of children&#x2019;s rights, but also in their implementation. But there are still many countries, wealthy and poor, where children&#x2019;s basic needs are not being met.<br><br>To read a summary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, go to www.unicef.org/crc/files/Rights_overview.pdf.</p><p><b>Alain Serres</b> was a kindergarten teacher who was inspired by his young students to write children&#x2019;s books.

Engagingly written and comprehensively researched, <i>The Naval War of 1812</i> exercised considerable influence on the formation of the modern American Navy and remains a cornerstone work in its field.<br>Drawing upon official documents, letters, and histories, Roosevelt portrays the political and social atmosphere in the United States and Great Britain prior to the war, taking particular note of America's unpreparedness. He then presents a balanced year-by-year chronicle of the war's progression on the Atlantic Ocean and the American lakes. Unlike prior histories, Roosevelt's account offers impartial assessments of the relative strengths and weaknesses of both sides. Four years after publication, the U.S. Navy ordered that a copy be placed on every ship, and it remains standard reading at the Naval Academy. The book contributed to Roosevelt's appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Navy and his role in the navy's development and modernization, resulting in a significant step toward America's rise as a world power.</p><p>The 26th President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt (1858&#x2013;1919) served as Chief Executive from 1901 to 1909.

His birthday was designated as Navy Day in honor of this longstanding interest in the U.S. Navy.</p><h2>The Elves and the Shoemaker (Folk Tale Classics) (Paul Galdone Nursery Classic)</h2><p>Late one night, a very poor shoemaker cuts his last two pieces of leather and goes to bed, worried about how he will support his family. He wakes to find two exquisitely made shoes in place of the leather. They are so beautiful that a customer pays more than the asking price, and the cobbler is able to buy enough leather for another pair of shoes.

Having spent years interviewing imprisoned criminals, including notorious serial killers, he discovered that the lack of remorse they showed was in many ways more terrifying than the crimes they had committed. Yet in the course of these conversations, the author also had the chance to interview his subjects' psychiatrists and, in doing so, uncovered a terrible truth: a monster can be hidden behind a friendly face. Some of these experts, he found, proved to have more in common with their patients than he would ever have expected. This book examines horrific crimes committed by some of the most remorseless and merciless people ever to have lived. If it reveals a mindset wholly alien to most people, it also, shockingly, demonstrates that some of the people who treat these psychopaths have their own demons. <i>Talking with Psychopaths</i> will inevitably shift the reader's view of psychopaths, and in doing so, reveals that horror can be much closer to us than we think. Subjects include JR Robinson, Kenneth Allen McDuff, Arthur Shawcross, Kenneth Bianchi, Michael Bruce Ross, Melanie McGuire, and more.<br></p><p><br><b>Christopher Berry-Dee</b> is a criminologist and true crime author whose books include <i>How to Make a Serial Killer</i>,<i> Monsters of Death Row</i>, and <i>Serial Killers: Up Close and Personal</i>.<br></p><h2>Freddie Mercury by Freestone, Peter (2001) Paperback</h2><p>An interesting story about Freddie Mercury by his private assistant.</p><p>&#39;The myth of Mercury&#39;s debauched private life is well and truly debunked by the man who was there throughout the toothsome showman&#39;s later years in this affectionate portrait...&#39; Q</p><h2>Missing People in America&#39;s National Parks: True Stories of Unexplained Disappearances</h2><p>There is a sinister side to National Parks; one the Forest Service does not want you to know about...

But for some, they go through the entrance, never to come out again. In the last century close to 1100 people have disappeared while on a visit to a National Park, just in the USA. Yet, research into this high rate of missing people associated with various National Parks around America is difficult.

Leia, in the copilot&#x2019;s seat, had&nbsp;her personal comlink to her ear.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;The <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s comm board was alive with Coruscant Security and&nbsp;traffic monitors warning Han to return to designated ship traffic lanes&nbsp;or be subject to arrest. He growled and switched the thing to silent&nbsp;mode. &#x201c;They found him?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;They found him. He&#x2019;s in an X-wing with a hole in the cockpit.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Armed?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Fifty&#x2014;fifty chance. It was in the Senate Building, so it&#x2019;s either a&nbsp;fully functional security vehicle or some Senator&#x2019;s unarmed memoriesof-&nbsp;youth vehicle. I&#x2019;m hoping for the second option.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Me, too.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Come to two-five-nine.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Nah.&#x201d; Han put the <i>Falcon </i>into a dive. His stomach fluttered, and&nbsp;the sensor screen filled up with tiny objects getting larger&#x2013;small-&nbsp;vehicle traffic at and below building-top level. Flashing down at terrifying&nbsp;and illegal speed, he twitched the controls right and left, nimbly&nbsp;dodging the much smaller civilian vehicles.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Han, what do you think&#x2013;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Then he was fully among them, streams of traffic above as well as&nbsp;below. He pulled out of his dive two hundred meters below the average&nbsp;height of the buildings.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;&#x2013;you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;This way, we&#x2019;re off the major sensor boards. Only vehicles with&nbsp;line of sight on us will complain.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I understand <i>that. </i>I mean, why not turn to two-five-nine?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;His course changes are just to jerk us around, to confuse us. <i>I&nbsp;</i>know where he&#x2019;s going.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;The spaceport, right at the edge of the government district. He&nbsp;stole a starfighter; that means he wants to make space. It&#x2019;s damaged,&nbsp;so he can&#x2019;t. He needs another one. Right?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;When it comes to piloting and pilots, I&#x2019;m all-knowing.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Leia put an artificial sweetness into her voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never argue with&nbsp;you again.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Han snorted and increased velocity. A Coruscant Security speeder&nbsp;following in his wake dropped back, left behind as though it were suddenly&nbsp;standing still.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke and Ben, in Ben&#x2019;s nimble red airspeeder, received the transmission&nbsp;with Han&#x2019;s guess about the spaceport.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke, at the controls, shook his head, not pleased. The spaceport,&nbsp;comparatively flat and built at a much lower altitude than the surrounding&nbsp;residential, business, and government zones, was not, as&nbsp;most supposed, actually situated at bedrock level. Below it were many&nbsp;levels of machinery, repair hangars, Empire-era emergency bunkers,&nbsp;spaceport employee facilities, and repair accesses.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;If Han was right and Valin was headed that way, even if he was unsuccessful&nbsp;at stealing another spaceworthy vehicle he might escape into&nbsp;those subterranean regions, making it hard or impossible to find him&nbsp;before he detected his tracking device and destroyed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Their speeder emerged from the skytowers and was abruptly out&nbsp;over the flatter region surrounding the spaceport. It was mostly given&nbsp;over to speeder parking, though it had decorative elements, including&nbsp;tree-spotted grassy regions and a small artificial lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And sensor stations. Almost immediately, the speeder&#x2019;s comm&nbsp;board began blaring with instructions for them to turn back, to stay&nbsp;away from restricted airspace.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Tell them who we are.&#x201d; Luke had to raise his voice to a shout to&nbsp;be heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I bet it doesn&#x2019;t work. Who&#x2019;s on the news as a criminal suspect?&nbsp;You are.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Do it anyway.&#x201d; Luke put the speeder into a holding pattern, keeping&nbsp;close to the ring of skytowers, not approaching the port itself. The&nbsp;authorities might well decide to shoot down a suspicious speeder&#x2013;&nbsp;piloted by a suspected criminal or not&#x2013;heading straight toward an invaluable&nbsp;government and civilian transportation resource. Sabotage&nbsp;and terror attacks had taken place as recently as the war, two years earlier.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Ben looked up from the comm board, startled. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not the only&nbsp;ones.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Luke scanned the airspace above the spaceport.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;There were a <i>lot </i>of small vehicles there now, most of them&nbsp;airspeeders of one size or another. Some were bigger business vehicles,&nbsp;many with lettering and symbols on the sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>From the utility compartment, Ben pulled out a pair of macro -&nbsp;binoculars and held them to his eyes. &#x201c;That one&#x2019;s a press vehicle.&nbsp;Turret-mounted holocam on top. That one&#x2013;hey, that&#x2019;s Jaina. The big&nbsp;green one&#x2013;oh, kriff.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Language. What is it?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;It has an oversized driver&#x2019;s cab and that Skakoan is in it.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke frowned. Suddenly everyone knew that Valin was coming&nbsp;here, including press and bounty hunters. That meant open comm&nbsp;channels were being monitored, and people with no business being&nbsp;here were up to date. Daala&#x2019;s people had to be doing this.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Then he saw it, almost at ground level, an X-wing painted in classic&nbsp;First Galactic Civil War grays. Its running lights were off; it was illuminated&nbsp;only by the glows from parking area pole lights&#x2013;it flew beneath&nbsp;the altitude of the lights themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on.&#x201d; Luke pushed his control yoke forward, sending the&nbsp;speeder into a precipitous dive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ben&#x2019;s lips were drawn back in a grimace&#x2013;perhaps because no&nbsp;teenager wants anyone else to endanger his vehicle recklessly, that&nbsp;being the teenager&#x2019;s own prerogative&#x2013;but said, &#x201c;<i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s incoming.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Luke put the speeder on an intercept course, or a collision&nbsp;course if anything went wrong, and switched the autopilot on. He unlatched&nbsp;his seat restraints and slid toward Ben. &#x201c;Take the controls.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He was gratified to see his son&#x2019;s eyes open wide, but Ben did as he&nbsp;was told; the boy unbuckled, slid under his father, grabbed the controls,&nbsp;disengaged the autopilot.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke stood up in the seat, drawing on the Force to keep him&nbsp;pinned in place despite the rush of wind threatening to tear him free.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He counted on Ben to know what to do, and his son did not let&nbsp;him down. Ben leveled off at the same altitude as the X-wing, completing&nbsp;his maneuver just meters behind the starfighter, and drew&nbsp;alongside that vehicle&#x2019;s port side.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke sprang across the gap separating his seat from the cockpit.&nbsp;The wind threatened to whip him away, but a boost of Force energy&nbsp;carried him to the fuselage just as Valin Horn was realizing he had a&nbsp;pace vehicle. Luke landed astride the nose, facing astern, staring&nbsp;straight down into Valin&#x2019;s startled features.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Valin yanked up on the X-wing&#x2019;s armrests. The canopy was suddenly&nbsp;open, snapping backward, and gone, and Valin hurtled into the&nbsp;sky, his pilot&#x2019;s chair propelled by a crude one-use rocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Stang! He punched out.&#x201d; Han pounded his steering yoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leia looked as aggravated as Han felt. &#x201c;Can the cargo tractor&nbsp;beam&#x2013;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Not strong enough. Can&#x2019;t compensate for a fast-moving target.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;We have to go after Valin, then.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Han shook his head. &#x201c;The ejection won&#x2019;t have left enough controls&nbsp;for Luke to land the X-wing. He may be able to lift it or push it down&nbsp;with the Force . . . but land it with no controls? No. We have to help&nbsp;him.&#x201d; He heeled over, diving toward the X-wing.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;He punched out.&#x201d; Jaina reluctantly turned her attention from Luke,&nbsp;disappearing toward the spaceport on the uncontrolled X-wing, and&nbsp;returned it to Valin, still ascending in his ejection seat. She banked and&nbsp;headed toward the rogue Jedi.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;In the passenger seat, Master Kyle Katarn, about Luke&#x2019;s age, darkhaired&nbsp;and dark-bearded, stretched as if coming out of a nap. &#x201c;You&nbsp;plan to maneuver underneath and catch him?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Katarn pointed toward another speeder, a large, flatbed cargo&nbsp;hauler with figures standing in the cargo bed. This vehicle rose toward&nbsp;Valin&#x2019;s position from a much nearer position. &#x201c;So do they.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Valin&#x2019;s seat reached its maximum altitude and began dropping. Immediately&nbsp;the short-term repulsor within the seat activated, slowing his&nbsp;descent.&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt as though he&#x2019;d taken a tremendous blow to the top of his&nbsp;head, doing no damage to it but compressing the spine beneath. Ejections&nbsp;were always like that&#x2013;bad, but better than the alternative.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;And he&#x2019;d always relish the look on Not-Luke&#x2019;s face when he&#x2019;d&nbsp;ejected. It had been priceless.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>A cargo hauler maneuvered itself toward his descent path. Grumbling,&nbsp;he got his lightsaber into one hand, grabbing his seat restraint&nbsp;buckle with the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As the hauler came underneath, instead of waiting for the seat to&nbsp;touch down, Valin unbuckled the restraints and flipped forward, landing&nbsp;on his feet moments before the seat landed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In the cargo bed, three individuals waited&#x2013;a Quarren with a vastly&nbsp;oversized weapon, a shining droid whose construction bore a slight resemblance&nbsp;to a human skeleton, and a tall blond woman whose black&nbsp;bantha-hide jacket was decorated with a vast number of claws and&nbsp;teeth in different sizes and colors, sewn in place; she carried a Wookiee&nbsp;bowcaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Valin smiled at them, but not in a friendly way. &#x201c;Two maladjusted&nbsp;want-to-be bounty hunters and their dressed-up protocol droid.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Surrender,&#x201d; the Quarren said. &#x201c;It will hurt less.&#x201d; He raised his&nbsp;preposterous weapon to his shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Jump into a fire.&#x201d; Valin all but ignored the two organic beings. He&nbsp;kept his attention on the droid&#x2013;a YVH 1 combat droid, one of the&nbsp;most dangerous machines to be found anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Now even machines were giving him a bad feeling. And he could&nbsp;detect a life-form heading toward him from straight above&#x2013;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He glanced upward to see a speeder car passing by overhead, and&nbsp;boot heels, flapping Jedi robes, and an illuminated lightsaber descending&nbsp;toward him at a normal falling rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In his lower peripheral vision, he saw the three bounty hunters&nbsp;glance up to spot the descending Jedi. Valin took the opportunity to&nbsp;act: he grabbed his abandoned ejection seat and leapt with it off the&nbsp;rear end of the cargo hauler.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaina landed in a crouch just where Valin had been standing. He was&nbsp;gone. She rose to glower at the bounty hunters. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not here to harm you,&#x201d; the YVH droid said, its tones utterly&nbsp;and confidently human.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Jaina stared at the thing, nonplussed. &#x201c;Just what have you been&nbsp;programmed for?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She felt a tickle in the Force, warning of imminent attack, and saw&nbsp;the Quarren&#x2019;s finger tighten on the trigger. She jumped to one side as&nbsp;he fired.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It did her no good. The missile that emerged from the weapon immediately&nbsp;flared out into a haze that wrapped around her, clinging&nbsp;everywhere&#x2013;it took her a fraction of a second to recognize it as a&nbsp;metal-mesh net trailing some sort of cylindrical package.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Then the first jolt of electrical pain hit her. Startled, suddenly separated&nbsp;from her Force powers, she sailed over the edge of the cargo&nbsp;hauler and dropped into empty space beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Valin clung to the ejection seat and rode it down another twenty meters.&nbsp;The next vehicle to approach him held no ersatz Jedi, no imposters&nbsp;that he could see&#x2013;it was a boxy blue speeder, the Galaxy 9&nbsp;News logo painted on its side in yellow. It drew alongside, its pilot&nbsp;skillfully keeping pace with Valin&#x2019;s rate of descent.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;A dark-skinned woman leaned out the passenger-side window.&nbsp;&#x201c;Jedi Horn! Is it true you&#x2019;re on a destructive rampage?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Valin leapt from his seat, slamming into the side of the speeder,&nbsp;holding on to the woman&#x2019;s door to keep from falling. She drew back,&nbsp;startled, but he gave her a friendly smile. &#x201c;Get me out of here, away&nbsp;from these people, and I&#x2019;ll give you the greatest scoop you&#x2019;ve ever&nbsp;had.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s eyes widened. She turned to issue a brief command&nbsp;to her pilot, then turned back, all smiles. &#x201c;Let me help you in . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll hang on here, thanks.&#x201d; The news speeder banked, sluggish,&nbsp;and headed toward the business district. &#x201c;How did you know I was&nbsp;Valin Horn?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;An arrest bulletin issued a little while ago by the office of the Chief&nbsp;of State . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quarren watched, startled, as Jaina Solo vanished over the lip.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The woman in the black jacket clapped him on the back. &#x201c;Nice&nbsp;move, fish-head. She&#x2019;s not&#x2013;&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Her words were cut off as an airspeeder, painted in a stylish silvergray,&nbsp;dived past the cargo hauler&#x2019;s cab, missing it by less than a meter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The hauler&#x2019;s pilot reacted instinctively, veering to starboard and&nbsp;down. The sudden maneuver sharply tilted the cargo bed.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;The Quarren staggered to his left and stumbled clean off the edge&nbsp;of the cargo hauler. The blond woman staggered, too, but dropped,&nbsp;rolled with an acrobat&#x2019;s skill, and fetched up safely against the low rail&nbsp;at the side of the cargo bed.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;The YVH droid didn&#x2019;t budge.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke flipped into the cockpit and did an involuntary dance for a moment&nbsp;until both feet found nonsuperheated areas on the floor of the&nbsp;still-smoking compartment.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;He glanced at the controls and grimaced. Every screen was out of&nbsp;commission. Experimentally, he waggled the yoke and found it unresponsive.&nbsp;This would be tricky, if not downright impossible.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Unless&#x2013;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;He turned. There, in the circular slot behind the cockpit, rested a&nbsp;gray and red R2 astromech.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Hey, there. Can you pilot this thing?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;The R2 tweetled, ending on a sorrowful note.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Forget steering. Can you kill the thrusters but leave the repulsors&nbsp;running?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;The R2 offered a series of notes that sounded quizzical.

Even today, in our largely materialistic world, we perform age-old rites to discover the shape of the future. In its many forms, divination is as much a part of our lives as it was in the ancient world. <br> <br>The practice of foretelling the future through the use of tools predates history and so we have no record of the first culture that acted upon its desire to peer into tomorrow. Perhaps the earliest forms consisted of gazing into lakes, watching the smoke rising from cooking and heating fires, and observing the shapes of clouds. In preliterate times all such phenomena were invested with spiritual energies, and it seems logical that it was to these that our ancestors turned for glimpses of tomorrow. <br> <br>In the great cultures of the past, divination was usually linked with religion. The deities, it was believed, were willing to provide hints of the future if they were given the opportunity to do so. This was provided to them by the presentation and use of specific tools, which the deities manipulated to provide specific responses. The earliest diviners thought that divination revealed the will of the deities. The future, they thought, was unchangeable. <br> <br>After many centuries of practice, however, it became obvious that this concept could easily be challenged. Why did some events revealed in predictions never occur? Weren&#x2019;t the deities in total control of human life? Some cultures answered such questions by altering their definition of divination. Rather than revealing a fated future, divination provided glimpses of possible future events. The future could be altered by human action. Thus, divination provided a window into potential tomorrows&#x2015;not of fate. Negative messages were now considered to be useful warnings, not inescapable messages of future doom. <br> <br>Today, divination is often defined as a branch of magic. This is untrue. The two practices are entirely different. Divination attempts to discover the past, present, or future, while magic is an active process by which the future is thought to be changed. Though magic and divination can be used together, they are in no way related. Those who claim that they are one and the same have no understanding of either practice, or have their own axes to grind. <br> <br><b>How It Works <br></b>There are many theories that attempt to explain the mechanism at work during divination, some of which are ap-plicable only to specific forms. In general, however, it is believed that our actions and thoughts produce nonphysical waves of energy that extend into the future, and thus shape it to a certain extent. They produce a map of tomorrow based on our current speed and direction, but many destinations lie upon its surface, and we can change course at any time. <br> <br>Divinatory techniques examine these energy waves&#x2015;which may not be consciously known to the diviner&#x2015;and, by taking them as well as other forces into account, paint a picture of the future&#x2015;if things continue on the present course for some time. <br> <br>The tools reveal the unknown information in a wide variety of ways. Some of these (the use of the pendulum or sand divination, for example) seem to rely on the subconscious mind, in which we become aware of these streams, to produce the response. <br> <br>Others techniques are completely free of our conscious or subconscious control, relying on other forces to manipulate the objects and to produce the prediction. In these forms, which are usually the most reliable, we simply present the tools and allow them to do the work. <br> <br><b>The Major Types of Divination <br></b>By studying the hundreds of techniques used in cultures throughout history, scholars have divided divination into two basic forms: operational and natural. Operational divination consists of the manipulation of tools (smoke, oil in water, eggs, dice, pieces of paper, knives, stones, and so on) to determine the future. Such tools are used in specific ways for this express purpose. These represent later developments of divinatory technique. <br> <br>Natural divination consists of the observation of occurrences in the natural world. A specific time and place is set aside for the express purpose of asking that omens derived from natural physical phenomena present themselves to reveal the future. The casual observation of omens that may unexpectedly occur at any time isn&#x2019;t true divination. Omens must be preceded by a request for information in order to be classified as divination. These are known as provoked omens. <br> <br>Such omens are created by the world around us. The flight or appearance of birds, the behavior of animals, observation of the stars and clouds, the wind&#x2019;s activity, and the sudden appearance of meteors and lightning are some popular forms. <br> <br><b>The Divinatory Response <br></b>Messages received during divination are known as responses. They usually take one of three forms. The nature of the technique determines the message&#x2019;s form. <br> <br>The first form produces so-called binary responses. The techniques that create binary responses are the easiest to perform and often produce the clearest answers. Questions are asked that can be answered with a yes or a no; hence the term binary. Occasionally, a third option, &#x201c;maybe,&#x201d; &#x201c;perhaps,&#x201d; or &#x201c;no answer&#x201d; is also included. <br> <br>The second response consists of the creation of symbols or images. These forms are termed symbolic. The divinatory tools (particularly crystal spheres, clouds, fire, smoke, and oil dropped into water) produce symbols that are interpreted in conjunction with the diviner&#x2019;s question. Forms that produce such responses aren&#x2019;t limited to answering specific questions; they can be used to determine the general future. The symbols thus produced are interpreted to provide information such as &#x201c;it will be a prosperous year,&#x201d; or &#x201c;expect losses,&#x201d; and so on. <br> <br>Symbolic responses rely both on the diviner&#x2019;s powers of observation as well as on her or his ability to unlock the symbols&#x2019; inner meanings. Generally speaking, only symbols familiar to the diviner will appear, and this enhances the probability of a successful interpretation. (See Chapter 4, Symbolic Thought.) <br> <br>The value of techniques that produce binary responses is obvious: no such interpretation is necessary. Both of these forms, however, can produce satisfactory results if used with the proper attitude. (See Chapter 3, The Fine Art of Divination, for further information.) <br> <br>The third type of divination produces what we may term selective responses. A number of likely future events are written on pieces of paper, leaves, stones, or on other tools. These are then manipulated (placed in a windy spot, chosen at random) to provide the most likely prediction. <br> <br><b>Divination Isn&#x2019;t Psychic Awareness <br></b>Many of the processes at work during divination are little understood. However, one fact is clear: true divination doesn&#x2019;t consist of the use of psychic abilities. It doesn&#x2019;t rely on a person&#x2019;s ability to tap into a bank of knowledge usually unknown to the conscious mind. Because of this, anyone, psychic or not, can successfully practice divination. <br> <br>It can certainly be argued that our psychic minds may be at work during some techniques&#x2015;that they examine waves of future energy and then relate them (through symbolic responses) to our conscious mind. No such awareness can be at work during techniques that produce binary or selective responses, yet all three systems can produce insightful answers. <br> <br>Some diviners still believe that higher beings manipulate the tools or, alternately, place symbols within them for us to see. This, the ancient view, may or may not be accepted according to the diviner&#x2019;s spiritual beliefs. Such a belief isn&#x2019;t necessary, for even nonreligious persons can satisfactorily perform divination. <br> <br><b>Why Is the Past of Importance? <br></b>Some question the need to examine the past to discover the future. This is based on the assumption that we know everything about our pasts because we&#x2019;ve lived them. <br> <br>Why, then, do so many divinatory techniques focus on both the past and the future? Most Tarot spreads (see Chapter 18) include a placement for a card that symbolizes the past as well as the future. Magic mirrors and other tools are used to illuminate the past, especially to see the circumstances surrounding a crime that has been committed at an earlier time. <br> <br>The fact remains that divination has always been used for this purpose. The explanation of why is rather simple: every day, we&#x2019;re building our futures. Every decision that we make affects tomorrow. When we&#x2019;re faced with a difficult situation, we may ask ourselves, &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; The answer often lies in the past. <br> <br>Though most of us can remember our pasts, we may not be able to make the conscious connection between past and present. We&#x2019;re incapable of seeing that we reap the fruits of our actions. If, yesterday, a man decided to sit on train tracks for twenty-four hours, and is then run over by the train, he&#x2019;s feeling the effects of his past decision. <br> <br>If we make unwise choices we&#x2019;ll suffer because of them. Deciding not to take an important medication may result in a severe relapse this week. If we allow another person to steer us away from our goals and dreams, we may find ourselves living an unfulfilling experience bereft of happiness. Moving to a town that&#x2019;s flooded every year during heavy rains will probably make our shoes wet. Though these are simple examples, the fact remains that many of us are simply unable to link past actions and the present state of our lives. <br> <br>The past also affects the future, for the streams of energy not only follow us, they race on into the future, continuing to mold our lives. Becoming aware of these past streams can not only answer questions concerning our present lives, but can also provide hints of the future. Therefore, examination of the past can be of great importance in divination. <br> <br>Divination remains a mysterious art. Perhaps this is part of its appeal. Scientific inquiry and education have largely stripped our lives of mystery. Though the purpose of divination is the clarification of the future, the manner in which this is achieved is highly romantic and evocative. This may explain why divination has never lost its popularity during the 5,000 years of its practice.<br></p><h2>The Mystery at the Dog Show (35) (The Boxcar Children Mysteries)</h2><p>During Greenfield&#39;s first dog show, Sunny is stolen.</p><p>Gertrude Chandler Warner was born in 1890 in Putnam, Connecticut, where she taught school and wrote The Boxcar Children because she had often imagined how delightful it would be to live in a caboose or freight car.

With oil reserves of several billion barrels, an estimated nine hundred trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and several centuries&#x2019; worth of competing territorial claims, the South China Sea in particular is a simmering pot of potential conflict. The underreported military buildup in the area where the Western Pacific meets the Indian Ocean means that it will likely be a hinge point for global war and peace for the foreseeable future.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Asia&#x2019;s Cauldron</i>, Robert D.

One of the world&#x2019;s most perceptive foreign policy experts, Kaplan interprets America&#x2019;s interests in Asia in the context of an increasingly assertive China. He explains how the region&#x2019;s unique geography fosters the growth of navies but also impedes aggression. And he draws a striking parallel between China&#x2019;s quest for hegemony in the South China Sea and the United States&#x2019; imperial adventure in the Caribbean more than a century ago.<br> &nbsp;<br> To understand the future of conflict in East Asia, Kaplan argues, one must understand the goals and motivations of its leaders and its people. Part travelogue, part geopolitical primer, <i>Asia&#x2019;s Cauldron</i> takes us on a journey through the region&#x2019;s boom cities and ramshackle slums: from Vietnam, where the superfueled capitalism of the erstwhile colonial capital, Saigon, inspires the geostrategic pretensions of the official seat of government in Hanoi, to Malaysia, where a unique mix of authoritarian Islam and Western-style consumerism creates quite possibly the ultimate postmodern society; and from Singapore, whose &#x201c;benevolent autocracy&#x201d; helped foster an economic miracle, to the Philippines, where a different brand of authoritarianism under Ferdinand Marcos led not to economic growth but to decades of corruption and crime.<br> &nbsp;<br> At a time when every day&#x2019;s news seems to contain some new story&#x2014;large or small&#x2014;that directly relates to conflicts over the South China Sea, <i>Asia&#x2019;s Cauldron</i> is an indispensable guide to a corner of the globe that will affect all of our lives for years to come.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Asia&#x2019;s Cauldron</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>&#x201c;<i>Asia&#x2019;s Cauldron</i> is a short book with a powerful thesis, and it stands out for its clarity and good sense. . . .

Therein lies a crucial difference between the twentieth and twenty-�first centuries. The most contested areas of the globe in the last century lay on dry land in Europe, particularly in the flat expanse that rendered the eastern and western borders of Germany artificial, and thus exposed to the intensive to-�ing and fro-�ing of armies. But starting in the last phase of the Cold War the demographic, economic, and military axis of the earth has measurably shifted to the opposite end of Eurasia, where the spaces between the principal nodes of population are overwhelmingly maritime. By maritime I mean sea, air, and outer space: for ever since the emergence of aircraft carriers in the early decades of the twentieth century, sea and air battle formations have become increasingly inextricable, with outer space now added to the mix because of navigational and other assistance to ships and planes from satellites. Hence naval has become shorthand for several dimensions of military activity. And make no mistake, naval is the operative word. Because of the way that geography illuminates and sets priorities, the physical contours of East Asia argue for a naval century, with the remote possibility of land warfare on the Korean Peninsula being the striking exception.<br><br>East Asia is a vast, yawning expanse, stretching from Arctic to Antarctic reaches&#x2014;�from the Kuril Islands southward to New Zealand&#x2014;�and characterized by a shattered array of coastlines and archipelagoes, themselves separated by great seas and distances. Even accounting for the fact of how technology has compressed distance, with missiles and fighter jets&#x2014;�the latter easily refueled in the air&#x2014;�rendering any geography closed and claustrophobic, the sea acts as a barrier to aggression, at least to the degree that dry land does not. The sea, unlike land, creates clearly defined borders, and thus has the potential to reduce conflict. Then there is speed to consider. Even the fastest warships travel comparatively slowly, 35 knots, say, reducing the chance of miscalculations and thus giving diplomats more hours&#x2014;�and days even&#x2014;�to reconsider decisions. Moreover, navies and air forces simply do not occupy territory the way armies do. It is because of the seas around East Asia that the twenty-�first century has a better chance than the twentieth of avoiding great military conflagrations.<br><br>Of course, East Asia has seen great military conflagrations in the twentieth century that the seas did not prevent: the Russo-�Japanese War (1904&#x2013;�1905); almost a half century of civil war in China that followed the collapse of the Qing (Manchu) dynasty; the conquests of Imperial Japan and World War II in the Pacific, which followed from them; the Korean War (1950&#x2013;�1953); the wars in Cambodia, Laos, and two in Vietnam involving the French and the Americans from the 1950s through the 1970s. What unites all of these conflicts is that each was organic to the formation of a state or empire, or similarly to the process of decolonization. A number of these conflicts were internal, contested by both conventional and unconventional ground forces, where navies played extremely limited roles. The fact that the grand geography of East Asia is primarily maritime had little impact on these essentially domestic wars. (I include Korea in this category: for the conflict between the North and the South was mainly fought on land, and was integral to the formation of separate states following the long Japanese occupation of 1910 to 1945.) But now the age of national consolidation throughout East Asia lies behind us. East Asian militaries, rather than focusing inward with low-�tech armies, are focusing outward with high-�tech navies and air forces. Yet as I will explain, they are not likely to reenact in terms of scale the naval conflicts of the Russo-�Japanese War and World War II in the Pacific.<br><br>The Russo-�Japanese War and the Pacific Theater in World War II were the upshots in significant measure of Japanese militarism, for which the seas offered no defense; in fact, the seas were fundamental to the expansion of an island nation that required large stores of oil from distant shores for its rampaging armed forces. But China, now the rising military power in the Pacific, demonstrates far less aggression than did Imperial Japan following the Meiji Restoration: even as China&#x2019;s military (particularly its navy) expands, fascism as in Japan is almost surely not on the horizon in the Middle Kingdom. As for the comparison between China and Imperial Germany prior to World War I that many make, whereas Germany was primarily a land power, owing to the geography of Europe, China will be primarily a naval power, owing to the geography of East Asia. It is this geography, I repeat, that will foster the growth of navies, which, while a worrisome trend in its own right, is still not as worrisome as the growth of armies in continental Europe at the beginning of the last century.<br><br>Truly, military power is moving to Asia, but the worst of the twentieth century might be avoided, thanks generally to what the University of Chicago political scientist John J. Mearsheimer calls the &#x201c;stopping power of water.&#x201d;1 Water, Mearsheimer explains, is an impediment to invasion because while a state can build a naval force and transport an army across the sea with it, such a state will find it much more difficult to land an army on a hostile shore, and then move it inland to subdue permanently a hostile population.<br><br>For example, the Taiwan Strait is only a hundred miles wide, making it one of the narrower waterways in the Western Pacific, but it is still almost four times wider than the English Channel, across which came the Allied invasion. China may in a decade or so be able to defeat Taiwan in a war, U.S. assistance to Taiwan notwithstanding. But occupying Taiwan would be far more difficult, and thus will likely never be attempted. This would not be the case if Taiwan were not an island with one hundred miles of water between it and the mainland. So it goes with the maritime distances between Japan and Korea, between South Korea and China, Japan&#x2019;s Ryuku Islands and China, China&#x2019;s Hainan Island and Vietnam, and so on. With postcolonial wars obviously no longer on the horizon, China however truculent is no Imperial Japan, and East Asia&#x2019;s maritime geography argues in favor of naval competition but militates against amphibious landings in heavily populated areas.<br><br>What will this purely naval competition look like? To find out we must examine more closely the geography of East Asia.<br><br>East Asia can be divided into two general areas: Northeast Asia dominated by the Korean Peninsula, and Southeast Asia dominated by the South China Sea. Northeast Asia pivots on the destiny of North Korea, a totalitarian and hermitic state that combines communism with national fascism. Such a state has dim prospects in a world governed by rampant capitalism and electronic communication. Were North Korea to collapse, Chinese, American, and South Korean ground forces might meet up in the peninsula&#x2019;s northern half in the mother of all humanitarian interventions, even as they carve out territory for themselves in the course of feeding the hungry. Naval issues would be distinctly secondary. But an eventual reunification of Korea would bring naval issues to the fore, with a Greater Korea, China, and Japan in delicate equipoise separated by the Sea of Japan and the Yellow and Bohai seas. In sum, because North Korea still exists, the Cold War phase of Northeast Asian history is not over, and thus land power will come to dominate the headlines in the area before sea power will.<br><br>Contrarily, Southeast Asia is already deep into a post&#x2013;�Cold War phase of history. That is what makes it so critical. Vietnam dominates the western shore of the South China Sea. Once the preeminent foreign symbol of domestic turmoil inside America, Vietnam has been&#x2014;�until recent years at least&#x2014;�a capitalist dynamo seeking closer military ties to the United States, in order to balance against China. China, consolidated as a dynastic state by Mao Zedong after decades of chaos, and made into the world&#x2019;s most dynamic economy by the liberalizations of Deng Xiaoping, is now pressing outward with its navy to the First Island Chain in the Western Pacific. Then there is the demographic Muslim behemoth of Indonesia, which, having sustained endless decades of left-� and right-�wing authoritarian rule during the Cold War, could possibly emerge as a second &#x201c;India,&#x201d; that is, a vigorous and stable democracy that has the potential to project power through its growing economy. Singapore and Malaysia, meanwhile, move forward economically in devotion to the city-�state-�cum-�trading-�state model, through varying blends of democracy and authoritarianism. Therefore, the composite picture is of a cluster of states that, with problems of domestic legitimacy and state building mostly behind them, are ready to advance their perceived territorial rights beyond their own shores. This outward collective push is located in the demographic cockpit of the globe: it is here in Southeast Asia, with its nearly 600 million people, where China&#x2019;s 1.3 billion people converge with the Indian Subcontinent&#x2019;s 1.5 billion people. And the geographical meeting place of all these states is maritime: the South China Sea.<br><br>The South China Sea functions as the throat of the Western Pacific and Indian oceans&#x2014;�the mass of connective economic tissue where global sea routes coalesce. Here is the heart of Eurasia&#x2019;s navigable rimland, punctuated by the Malacca, Sunda, Lombok, and Makassar straits. More than half of the world&#x2019;s annual merchant fleet tonnage passes through these choke points, and a third of all maritime traffic worldwide.2 The oil transported through the Malacca Strait from the Indian Ocean, en route to East Asia through the South China Sea, is triple the amount that passes through the Suez Canal and fifteen times the amount that transits the Panama Canal. Roughly two thirds of South Korea&#x2019;s energy supplies, nearly 60 percent of Japan&#x2019;s and Taiwan&#x2019;s energy supplies, and 80 percent of China&#x2019;s crude oil imports come through the South China Sea.3 Whereas in the Persian Gulf only energy is transported, in the South China Sea you have energy, finished goods, and unfinished goods.<br><br>In addition to centrality of location, the South China Sea has proven oil reserves of seven billion barrels, and an estimated 900 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. If Chinese calculations are correct that the South China Sea will ultimately yield 130 billion barrels of oil (and there is some serious doubt about these estimates), then the South China Sea contains more oil than any area of the globe except Saudi Arabia. Some Chinese observers have called the South China Sea &#x201c;the second Persian Gulf.&#x201d;4 If there really is so much oil in the South China Sea, then China will have partially alleviated its &#x201c;Malacca dilemma&#x201d;&#x2014;�its reliance on the narrow and vulnerable Strait of Malacca for so much of its energy needs coming from the Middle East. And the China National Offshore Oil Corporation has invested $20 billion in the belief that such amounts of oil really do exist in the South China Sea.5 China is desperate for new energy. Chinese oil reserves account for only 1.1 percent of the world total, while it consumes over 10 percent of world oil production and over 20 percent of all the energy consumed on the planet.6<br><br>It is not only location and energy reserves that promise to give the South China Sea critical geostrategic importance, it is the territorial disputes surrounding these waters, home to more than two hundred small islands, rocks, and coral reefs, only about three dozen of which are permanently above water. Yet these specks of land, buffeted by typhoons, are valuable mainly because of the oil and natural gas that might lie nearby in the intricate, folded layers of rock beneath the sea. Brunei claims a southern reef of the Spratly Islands. Malaysia claims three islands in the Spratlys. The Philippines claims eight islands in the Spratlys and significant portions of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Taiwan, and China each claims much of the South China Sea, as well as all of the Spratly and Paracel island groups. In the middle of 2010 there was quite a stir when China was said to have called the South China Sea a &#x201c;core interest.&#x201d; It turns out that Chinese officials never quite said that: no matter. Chinese maps have been consistent. Beijing claims to own what it calls its &#x201c;historic line&#x201d;: that is, the heart of the entire South China Sea in a grand loop&#x2014;�the &#x201c;cow&#x2019;s tongue&#x201d; as the loop is called&#x2014;�surrounding these island groups from China&#x2019;s Hainan Island south 1,200 miles to near Singapore and Malaysia. The result is that all of these littoral states are more or less arrayed against China, and dependent upon the United States for diplomatic and military backing. For example, Vietnam and Malaysia are seeking to divide all of the seabed and subsoil resources of the southern part of the South China Sea between mainland Southeast Asia and the Malaysian part of the island of Borneo: this has elicited a furious diplomatic response from China.7 These conflicting claims are likely to become more acute as energy consumption in developing Asian countries is expected to double by 2030, with China accounting for half of that growth.8<br><br>&#x201c;Paradoxically, if the postmodern age is dominated by globalization,&#x201d; writes the British naval expert Geoffrey Till, then &#x201c;everything that supports&#x201d; globalization, such as trade routes and energy deposits, becomes fraught with competition. And when it comes to trade routes, 90 percent of all commercial goods that travel from one continent to another do so by sea. This heightened maritime awareness that is a product of globalization comes at a time when a host of relatively new and independent states in Southeast Asia, which only recently have had the wherewithal to flex their muscles at sea, are making territorial claims against each other that in the days of the British Empire were never an issue, because of the supremacy of the Crown globally and its emphasis on free trade and freedom of navigation.9 This muscle flexing takes the form of &#x201c;routinized&#x201d; close encounters between warships of different nations at sea, creating an embryonic risk of armed conflict.10<br><br>One high-�ranking official of a South China Sea littoral state was particularly blunt during an off-�the-�record conversation I had in 2011, saying, &#x201c;The Chinese never give justifications for their claims. They have a real Middle Kingdom mentality, and are dead set against taking these disputes to court. China,&#x201d; this official went on, &#x201c;denies us our right on our own continental shelf. But we will not be treated like Tibet or Xinjiang.&#x201d; This official said that China is as tough with a country like the Philippines as it is with Vietnam, because while the latter is historically and geographically in a state of intense competition with China, the former is just a weak state that can be intimidated. &#x201c;There are just too many claimants to the waters in the South China Sea. The complexity of the issues mitigates against an overall solution, so China simply waits until it becomes stronger. Economically, all these countries will come to be dominated by China,&#x201d; the official continued, unless of course the Chinese economy itself unravels. Once China&#x2019;s underground submarine base is completed on Hainan Island, &#x201c;China will be more able to do what it wants.&#x201d; Meanwhile, more American naval vessels are visiting the area, &#x201c;so the disputes are being internationalized.&#x201d; Because there is no practical political or judicial solution, &#x201c;we support the status quo.&#x201d;<br><br>...</p><h2>Animal-wise: Understanding the Language of Animal Messengers and Companions (10th Anniversary Edition)</h2><p>In this 10 year anniversary edition of Ted Andrews&#39; best selling and award winning book on animals, Ted expands and revises the entire work.

For many of the later years, FE engines were used primarily in truck applications. However, the FE engine is experiencing a renaissance; it is now popular in high-performance street, strip, muscle cars, and even high-performance trucks. While high-performance build-up principles and techniques are discussed for all engines, author Barry Rabotnick focuses on the max-performance build-up for the most popular engines: the 390 and 428. <p>With the high-performance revival for FE engines, a variety of builds are being performed from stock blocks with mild head and cam work to complete aftermarket engines with aluminum blocks, high-flow heads, and aggressive roller cams. <i>How to Build Max-Performance Ford FE Engines</i> shows you how to select the ideal pistons, connecting rods, and crankshafts to achieve horsepower requirements for all applications. The chapter on blocks discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each particular block considered. The book also examines head, valvetrain, and cam options that are best suited for individual performance goals. Also covered are the best-flowing heads, rocker-arm options, lifters, and pushrods. In addition, this volume covers port sizing, cam lift, and the best rocker-arm geometry. </p><p>The FE engines are an excellent platform for stroking, and this book provides an insightful, easy-to-follow approach for selecting the right crank, connecting rods, pistons, and making the necessary block modifications.

For many years, the FE engine was not the engine of choice for high-performance applications, but the FE engine has enjoyed a high-performance renaissance on street and strip as well as in trucks. During its 18-year production run, a wide range of displacements were offered&#x2013;332, 352, 361, 390, 391, 406, 410, 427, and 428. How to Build Max-Performance Ford FE Engines shows you how to select the best components and build a max-performance FE for almost any application. Author Barry Rabotnick explains the tips, techniques, and parts-selection tricks for building a strong, complementary, max-performance engine package. In the pursuit of ultimate high-performance, Rabotnick focuses engine build-up guidance on the most popular FE engines&#x2015;the 390 and 428. To get the most from an engine, you need a strong block for a solid foundation. The block chapter reveals specific design features you need and how to inspect critical areas, so you can select a sound stock block or the ideal aftermarket block for your desired performance level. Since the top end needs to match the block, the intricacies and ideal head, valvetrain, and cam combinations are discussed. And the author goes a step further&#x2015;he covers the best flowing heads, rocker arm, lifters, and pushrod options for a particular setup. In addition, the book covers port sizing, cam lift, and the best rocker-arm geometry for a variety of setups. The FE engines are an excellent platform for stroking, so an insightful, easy-to-follow approach is provided for selecting the right rotating assembly. In the end, you will be able to build a high-performance, realiable FE that suits your vehicle and application.Barry Rabotnick has worked at Holley and later managed the performance parts program at Federal Mogul. He currently owns and operates Survival Motorsports, which specializes in high-performance FE engine parts, machine services, and engine building. He built a 750-horsepower FE engine that runs on 91 octane for Jeg&#39;s Engine Master&#39;s Challenge.

Morris is livid, not just because his favorite writer has stopped publishing, but because Jimmy Gold ended up as a sellout. Morris kills his idol and empties his safe of cash, but the real haul is a collection of notebooks containing John Rothstein&#x2019;s unpublished work...including at least one more Jimmy Gold novel. Morris hides everything away before being locked up for another horrific crime. But upon Morris&#x2019;s release thirty-five years later, he&#x2019;s about to discover that teenager Pete Saubers has already found the stolen treasure&#x2014;and no one but former police detective Bill Hodges, along with his trusted associates Holly Gibney and Jerome Robinson, stands in the way of his vengeance....<br> <br> Not since <i>Misery</i> has Stephen King played with the notion of a reader and murderous obsession, in this #1 acclaimed bestseller filled with &#x201c;nail biting suspense that&#x2019;s the hallmark of [his] best work&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>).</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2015:</strong> For those of you who spent part of last summer being thrilled by Stephen King&#x2019;s <em>Mr. Mercedes</em>, this worthy sequel arrives just in time for summer 2015. Of course you can read <em>Finders Keepers</em> on its own if you&#x2019;re so-inclined&#x2014;King takes time to introduce new characters and new crimes in the first half of the book before carting out some familiar faces from the past. The story begins with a murder (of an author) and a robbery (of the author&#x2019;s notebooks, including at least one unpublished manuscript). The crimes will linger in your mind, but what might linger most is when King explores his obsessions with, well, obsessions: obsession with reading, obsession with writers, even the need to get revenge. The book is well-plotted, but there remains an organic feel to this series, like the characters are writing themselves to some extent. As a character in <em>Finders Keepers</em> puts it, &#x201c;a good novelist does not create events, he watches them happen then writes down what he sees. A good novelist realizes he is a secretary, not God.&#x201d; Amen. That's why we love you, Stephen King.<em>--Chris Schluep</em></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

Born Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud in Charleville, France, in 1854, Rimbaud&#x2019;s family moved to Cours d&#x2019;Orl�ans, when he was eight, where he began studying both Latin and Greek at the Pension Rossat. While he disliked school, Rimbaud excelled in his studies and, encouraged by a private tutor, tried his hand at poetry. Shortly thereafter, Rimbaud sent his work to the renowned symbolist poet Paul Verlaine and received in response a one-way ticket to Paris. By late September 1871, at the age of sixteen, Rimbaud had ignited with Verlaine one of the most notoriously turbulent affairs in the history of literature. Their relationship reached a boiling point in the summer of 1873, when Verlaine, frustrated by an increasingly distant Rimbaud, attacked his lover with a revolver in a drunken rage. The act sent Verlaine to prison and Rimbaud back to Charleville to finish his work on <em>A Season in Hell</em>. The following year, Rimbaud traveled to London with the poet Germain Nouveau, to compile and publish his transcendent <em>Illuminations</em>. It was to be Rimbaud&#x2019;s final publication. By 1880, he would give up writing altogether for a more stable life as merchant in Yemen, where he stayed until a painful condition in his knee forced him back to France for treatment. In 1891, Rimbaud was misdiagnosed with a case of tuberculosis synovitis and advised to have his leg removed. Only after the amputation did doctors determine Rimbaud was, in fact, suffering from cancer. Rimbaud died in Marseille in November of 1891, at the age of 37. He is now considered a saint to symbolists and surrealists, and his body of works, which include <em>Le bateau ivre</em> (1871), <em>Une Saison en Enfer</em> (1873), and <em>Les Illuminations</em> (1873), have been widely recognized as a major influence on artists stretching from Pablo Picasso to Bob Dylan.</p><p>Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning poet <strong>John Ashbery</strong> (1927&#x2015;2017) translated many French writers, including Alfred Jarry, Pierre Reverdy, and Raymond Roussel.

Rosenfelt's hilarious account of this cross-country move, <i>Dogtripping</i>, is being published by St. Martin's Press in July 2013.</p><br>&nbsp; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>The three vehicles provided a surprisingly stable ride. The countryside in this desolate area of the world was rugged, famously so, but the cars were all-terrain models and could handle much worse. Besides, the ride would last half an hour maximum, and the passengers were not exactly unfamiliar with hardship and Spartan conditions. <br>Altogether there were eight men in the cars, three in the one in front, three in back, and two in the center car. Seven of the eight men were of little consequence in the grand scheme of things; they were there as protectors for one of the men in the middle car. <br>His name was Aarif Sajadi, and he was the target. <br>The aircraft flew twenty-one thousand feet above them, and they could neither hear nor see it. There were no passengers on board the flight; there never were. No flight attendants, no carry-on baggage compartments, no tray tables to be stowed, not even any seats to be restored to their original upright positions. <br>The pilot, Sergeant Brian Cole, could see the cars clearly, but even if the men stopped, took out incredibly powerful telescopes, and peered upward, they could not have seen him. That&#x2019;s because they were in the mountainous region of Pakistan, near the Afghanistan border, and he was sitting in a room at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, drinking coffee and nibbling on a blueberry muffin. <br>The aircraft that Cole was piloting was a MQ-1B Predator drone. Many people thought of drones almost as small model airplanes, carrying cameras and functioning as eyes in the skies. But this one was twenty-seven feet long, had a wingspan of fifty-five feet, and weighed almost fifteen hundred pounds, including its two Hellfire missiles. <br>Cole was literally flying it with the use of a console and joystick, as if he were playing a video game. He tried to fully concentrate, as his training dictated, but it wasn&#x2019;t easy. He&#x2019;d had a fight with his wife that morning before coming to work, and it was weighing on his mind. He thought maybe, when he was finished, that he should send her flowers. <br>Fortunately for Brian, though less so for the men in the cars, the Predator&#x2019;s MTS, or Multi-Spectral Targeting System, was doing most of the important work. Through the use of lasers, it had already homed in on the target and told the missiles where to go. All Cole would have to do was tell them when, by pressing a button. <br>At this point, the cars&#x2019; passengers were lucky to be blissfully unaware. Were they suddenly to know of the aircraft and its intentions, there was nothing they could have done about it. The nearest cover was too far for them to reach in the little time available to them. <br>They were dead men driving. <br>Cole did not think much about the political or legal implications of what he was about to do. He knew he was functioning as part of the American government&#x2019;s strategy of targeted killings, and he certainly assumed that the target in this case was considered a terrorist bent on inflicting harm to the United States. <br>And that was absolutely true. <br>Cole was forever seeing claims in the media that the number-three person in the terrorist network had been killed; probably fifteen &#x201c;number threes&#x201d; had bitten the dust in the past year. Cole had no idea how many of those killings he had been responsible for, if any, but there was one thing he knew for sure: If he ever became a terrorist and reached number four in the chain of command, he wouldn&#x2019;t want to get promoted. <br>A final systems check was accomplished, Cole pressed the button, and the three cars, as well as their occupants, ceased to exist. For Cole, having been at this for a while, it was business as usual. <br>But what he did not know was that Aarif Sajadi was not like any other target. If Sajadi did not die instantly, then in his last moments he likely took some comfort in the fact that he had already plotted his revenge against his killers, halfway around the world. <br>His death did nothing to change that. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>I, Andy Carpenter, am not often stunned. I&#x2019;m a criminal defense attorney, and I&#x2019;ve handled some high-profile cases with many twists and turns, so I&#x2019;ve generally learned to go with the flow, to expect the unexpected. <br>I am therefore difficult to surprise, but at 7:34 P.M. on March 17, in my Paterson, New Jersey, office, I have just seen something that has left me shaken to the core. <br>Edna. <br>I used to think of Edna as my secretary, until she informed me she was my &#x201c;administrative assistant.&#x201d; Then, a couple of years ago, she self-elevated her status to &#x201c;office manager.&#x201d; She most often &#x201c;manages&#x201d; the office from a remote location, since she works maybe one day a week. <br>Actually, I&#x2019;ve overstated it. She comes in one day a week, but she gets almost no work done even then. Instead she endlessly does crossword puzzles and considers herself the best in the world at it. She also talks on the phone a great deal, mostly with her enormous extended family. <br>But to see her here in the evening, outside of business hours, is disorienting. Edna simply does not work overtime. She doesn&#x2019;t even work regular time. <br>In fact, it&#x2019;s more than disorienting; it&#x2019;s astonishing. It would be like walking into a bowling alley and seeing the queen of England throwing practice balls on lane fourteen. Yet here Edna is, hunched over her desk, writing on some papers, so engrossed that she barely looks up when I arrive. <br>With her is Sam Willis, my accountant, who has an office down the hall. He&#x2019;s sitting on a couch, but Edna&#x2019;s not paying any attention to him; she&#x2019;s too intent on what she&#x2019;s doing. Sam&#x2019;s the reason I&#x2019;m here. He said he wanted to talk with me about something important. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Sam&nbsp;&#x2026; Edna,&#x201d; I say, which is a witty opening conversational gambit I&#x2019;ve recently come up with. <br>&#x201c;Andy, thanks for coming in,&#x201d; Sam says, while Edna merely manages an &#x201c;mmm,&#x201d; without looking up. <br>I tell Sam to come into my office so we can talk. Once we get in there, I close the door and say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s seven thirty, and Edna&#x2019;s here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So did we turn the clocks back or something, and I didn&#x2019;t realize it?&#x201d; <br>He shakes his head. &#x201c;No, but even that would be just an hour. She&#x2019;d still be here late.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I meant, did we turn the clocks back to 1978?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s tournament time,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been practicing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aaahh.&#x201d; Suddenly it all makes sense. Edna has long been talking about entering a national crossword puzzle tournament, held once a year in Brooklyn. She&#x2019;s never actually entered, and I&#x2019;ve always assumed it was due to some secret self-doubt about her prowess. But now she seems to be ready to throw her pencil in the ring. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re going to get much work out of her these next few weeks,&#x201d; Sam says. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a shocker. What did you want to talk to me about?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, I think I may have a new client for you.&#x201d; <br>Sam says that with an expression and tone in his voice that indicate he thinks he is giving me good news. &#x201c;Yippee skippee,&#x201d; I say. <br>I have a lot of money, many millions, some earned and more inherited. What I don&#x2019;t have is a desire to work. I&#x2019;m not sure where I left it, but it&#x2019;s been missing for a while, and I haven&#x2019;t searched real hard. <br>Unfortunately, even though I don&#x2019;t seek clients, I seem to wind up with some, and long trials have often been the result. Working long trials is the only thing I dislike more than working short trials. <br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t interested in new clients?&#x201d; Sam asks. <br>&#x201c;What tipped you off?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay. Whatever you say.&#x201d; Sam seems rather chagrined at my reaction. He thought he was doing something good for a friend, and the friend just blew him off. I decide to soften the blow by acting half interested. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the case? Maybe I can recommend someone.&#x201d; <br>He shrugs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. I went to high school with this guy, Barry Price. Last time I had seen him was a couple of years ago, at the reunion. I think I told you about him; he&#x2019;s the guy who married my high school sweetheart, Denise.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How come you didn&#x2019;t?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Believe it or not, I dumped her when I went off to college. Biggest mistake of my life.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry to hear that.&#x201d; Coming here is now showing signs of being one of the biggest mistakes of my life. This is already a long story, and Laurie Collins is waiting for me at home. That means that no matter what Sam was telling me, I&#x2019;d want him to hurry the hell up. <br>&#x201c;Anyway, he calls me the other day and invites me to a party at his house last night; you should see this place. I&#x2019;m not sure why he invited me, but as I&#x2019;m leaving, he asks if I can come back tonight, that he needs my help. He sounded a little worried about something, but he wouldn&#x2019;t tell me what. Then he asked if I still knew you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How did he know that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I guess I mentioned you at the reunion, sort of name-dropping, you know? You&#x2019;re famous. He said he might want to hire you, and could I put the two of you together.&#x201d; <br>I&#x2019;ve had a lot of high-profile cases over the years, many of which have been heavily covered in the media. But famous? Aww, shucks. <br>He continues. &#x201c;He told me to pack a bag, that we&#x2019;d be flying somewhere on his private plane. Barry&#x2019;s really rich, in case that changes your mind.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Sam. Not a chance.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Really? I thought you might even come out there with me tonight.&#x201d; <br>I shake my head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m retired.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Officially?&#x201d; <br>I look at my watch and nod. &#x201c;Effective seven forty-two P.M. But if you let me know what&#x2019;s going on, I&#x2019;ll recommend another lawyer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As good as you?&#x201d; he asks. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous.&#x201d; <br>Sam heads off to his friend&#x2019;s house, and I head home to Laurie. Edna remains at her desk, with no signs of leaving any time soon. <br>We have entered the bizarro world, where black is white, up is down, left is right, and Edna is in the office after five o&#x2019;clock. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Like so many of these things, it began in a bar. Drew Keller was in the right place at the right time. And while an undercover cop&#x2019;s job was, in fact, to be in that right place at that right time, Drew had to admit to himself that this was more than a little lucky. <br>He was investigating a series of auto parts thefts in the Concord, New Hampshire, area, and had developed a relationship with a possible suspect whom he believed held some promise. The man&#x2019;s name was Rodney Larsen, and he was straight out of central casting for someone in Drew&#x2019;s line of work. Rodney was a walking undercover trifecta&#x2014;stupid, talkative, and boastful. <br>Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s hard to reveal information that you don&#x2019;t have, and Drew was starting to believe that his instinct was wrong, that Rodney was a dry well when it came to the robberies. <br>And then he caught a possible break. <br>It took three nights and a whole bunch of beers, but Rodney said that his brother and another friend were going to &#x201c;kill a big shot&#x201d; and that he was a part of the team. He wouldn&#x2019;t say much more, but when Drew convinced him that he had access to high-tech weaponry and the willingness to use it, he was promised an invite to meet the others and possibly join the team. <br>So the plan was for them to come to the bar the next night to get to know Drew and see if he was suitable to sign up for whatever they had planned. He was there at midnight, and Rodney was waiting for him. <br>But the plan had changed. <br>Rodney&#x2019;s coconspirators had decided that they didn&#x2019;t think the meeting should be in public, so Rodney said that he and Drew were supposed to leave the bar and meet at their &#x201c;place.&#x201d; <br>Because the original meeting was going to be in the public bar, Drew had not arranged for backup and surveillance. He was not comfortable heading into this situation, where he might be vulnerable, so he told Rodney that he would follow him in his car. That way he&#x2019;d be able to call in for backup while he was on the way, and they could follow the GPS device that he would activate on his car. <br>But when they got to the parking lot, it all changed for the worse. Much worse. Rodney&#x2019;s brother Alex was waiting there, and he came up behind Drew and held a gun to his back. Then he took Drew&#x2019;s concealed weapon, forced him into Rodney&#x2019;s car, and they drove off together. <br>Drew was alone, and he was in trouble. <br>They drove to a service station about three miles away. The station was closed for the night, but the back room was open and occupied. Still at gunpoint, Drew was forced into that room, where two other men were waiting for them. <br>One of the men was Earl Raulston, the third member of the group. The other was a man the three conspirators knew only as Carter. They assumed it was a last name, but no one was really sure. What was obvious, however, even to Drew, was that Carter did not fit in with this crew and that he was in charge. <br>&#x201c;Where is his gun?&#x201d; were the first words out of Carter&#x2019;s mouth. Alex, obviously proud that he had been the one to confiscate it, rushed over to Carter to hand it to him. Carter looked in the chamber to confirm that it was loaded and then put it on the table. <br>&#x201c;You are an undercover officer attempting to thwart our operation,&#x201d; Carter said. <br>&#x201c;Hey, man, this is bullshit,&#x201d; was Drew&#x2019;s response. &#x201c;Rodney here said there was some action to get in on, that&#x2019;s all. If you don&#x2019;t want me, that&#x2019;s cool.&#x201d; <br>Carter had no intention of arguing the point. Instead he took out his own gun and, without hesitating, shot Drew in the head, killing him instantly. <br>The others in the room were stunned, but no one was about to offer any criticism. &#x201c;I knew he was dirty,&#x201d; Rodney said. <br>&#x201c;This doesn&#x2019;t change anything, does it?&#x201d; Alex asked. <br>&#x201c;Actually, it changes everything,&#x201d; Carter said. He picked up Drew&#x2019;s gun from the desk, and in a devastatingly quick motion, shot the other three men with it. <br>He had the ability to have cleanly killed each with one bullet in the center of the forehead, but that&#x2019;s not how it would have gone down in a chaotic firefight. So now he fired more erratically, and in the case of Alex and Earl, used two shots to make the kill. <br>The three murders took fewer than five seconds, leaving Carter the only living person in the room. And he would be there for a while; this was a scene that would have to be choreographed. <br>What law enforcement would find would be implausible but not impossible. Which would be plenty good enough. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Sam Willis kept his glove compartment full. In addition to the registration, insurance card, and other documents that are found in most cars, he kept a substantial number of wrapped Weight Watchers Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. He found them surprisingly good, and even though they obviously weren&#x2019;t fattening, he was able to overcome that deficiency by inhaling up to ten at a time. <br>But when Sam was driving, the glove compartment was also an electronics warehouse. He kept his iPad, iPhone, and BlackBerry tucked away in there, which was essentially an act of self-preservation.

It was not for their own land they fought, not even for a land which had adopted them, but for a land which had enslaved them, and whose laws, even in freedom, oftener oppressed than protected. Bravery, under such circumstances, has a peculiar beauty and merit.&#x201d;<br><br> Nell&#x2019;s work is a brilliant reassessment of history and wonderfully explains the contributions of African-Americans to the War of Independence. <br><br> Jessie Carney Smith in her book <em>Black First</em> also explains that this work deserves acknowledgement in its own right because it was &#x201c;the first substantial historical work by a black man in America.&#x201d; <br><br> William Cooper Nell was an African-American abolitionist, author and civil servant of Boston. He worked tirelessly at the outbreak of the American Civil War to get black soldiers accepted into the Union Army. He died in 1874 at the age of 58.

His arguments are as persuasively reasoned and analytical as they are passionate and moving, as challenging in their message as they are disarming in their humor. Though appropriately titled, the book at core really urges us all to a better understanding of the current saga of athlete protests, protests that are testament to what we already have become as a society and a warning about where we might be headed as a nation, protests that constitute a cautionary tale that should make us all, irrespective of race,&nbsp; at least a little&nbsp; &#x2018;uncomfortable,&#x2019; perhaps even uncomfortable enough to &#x2018;grow in our own responsiveness to the call to form that more Perfect Union.&#x2019; A must-read&nbsp; for anyone looking to better understand today&#x2019;s political climate in American sports.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;Harry Edwards, author of&nbsp;<em>The Revolt of the Black Athlete</em></strong></p> <p>&#x201c;Michael Bennett is one of the most outspoken and progressive voices in the NFL.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;<em>The Root &#x2018;100 Most Influential African Americans 2017&#x2032;</em></strong></p> <p>&#x201c;With vulnerability, humility, and the courage to tell the truth, Michael Bennett reminds us at the heart of every social awakening are ordinary people who choose justice and resistance over silence and comfort. In a profession where independent thought is punished, Michael Bennett lays it all on the line with this book. Bennett&#x2019;s insights into everything from Black Lives Matter, to college athletics, to intersectional feminism will not only make white people uncomfortable, but it will challenge the status quo of our entire society.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, author of&nbsp;<em>From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation</em></strong></p> <p>&#x201c;Michael Bennet is a warrior for justice.&nbsp; His spirit is in line and step with all those freedom fighters who came before him.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;Craig Hodges, author of&nbsp;<em>Long Shot: The Triumphs and Struggles of An NBA Freedom Fighter</em></strong></p> <p>&#x201c;In a social media age where professional athletes are regularly criticized by anyone with a twitter account, Michael Bennett has the courage to stand up for what he believes despite the possibility of losing fans, support or endorsements. Whether it&#x2019;s speaking on police brutality, systemic racism, Black Lives Matter, or human rights for Palestinian people he doesn&#x2019;t hesitate to lend his voice. This book is a live wire.

And that is precisely the point. Because Michael Bennett is one of the most outspoken and dynamic athletes in America today, and his co-writer, Dave Zirin, is very clearly our nation&#x2019;s most fearless sports journalist. Together they are Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell bringing the noise about race, sports, and the wonderfully diverse life that is Michael Bennett&#x2019;s journey as a Black man who refuses to be stereotyped. At a time when the protests of sport heroes like Bennett and Colin Kaepernick have once more revealed the huge racial divides that have always been present, what makes this book different, and so unique, is that Bennett remixes the past into an unavoidable and necessary dialogue for this 21st century, on his own terms. Indeed, Michael Bennett's voice echoes that of Jack Johnson, Paul Robeson, Ali. And his voice is that of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, too. Because Michael Bennett is clear, mad clear, that he is a leader and a change agent, too.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;Kevin Powell, author of&nbsp;<em>The Education of Kevin Powell: A Boy&#x2019;s Journey into Manhood</em></strong></p></p><h2>Leaving Blythe River: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Catherine Ryan Hyde comes an unforgettable story of courage and finding forgiveness in an unforgiving wilderness.</b></p><p>Seventeen-year-old Ethan Underwood is totally unprepared to search for his father in the Blythe River National Wilderness.

It was also&nbsp;the start of one of the most astonishing whodunits in the history of American true crime: how one man extorted $200,000 from an airline before parachuting into the wilds of the Pacific Northwest, never to be seen again. <br><br>Starting with a crack tip from a private investigator, author Geoffrey Gray plunges into the murky depths of the decades-old mystery to chase down new clues and explore the secret lives of the cases's cast of characters and most promising suspects, including Ralph Himmelsbach, the most dogged of FBI agents, who watched with horror as a criminal became a counter-culture folk hero; Karl Fleming, a respected reporter whose career was destroyed by a D.B. Cooper scoop that was a scam; and Barbara (nee Bobby) Dayton, a transgendered pilot who insisted she was Cooper herself. <br><br>The case of D.B.

We know who Deep Throat was. We know where Thomas Pynchon lives. The missing 18 minutes on the Nixon tapes have proved unrecoverable. But then, winking at us like one last taunting fossil from the violent, paranoid 1970s, there&#x2019;s the baffling case of D.B. Cooper.</p> <p>On November 24, 1971, a man calling himself Dan Cooper hijacked a Boeing 727, demanded $200,000 and parachutes, and jumped out over the Pacific Northwest. At a time when the country was beset by war, assassinations, riots, a faltering economy, and the Nixon presidency, Cooper was heralded as a Robin Hood of the sky. Enormous investigative resources were marshaled. Ballads were written. Cooper was never heard from again.</p> <p>Forty years later, Geoffrey Gray dives chute-less into the swirling abyss of Cooper mania and lands with a true non-fiction novel, with characters too eccentric to be invented and a hurtling pace rarely found in the world of fact. The writing is stylish. The reporting is unstoppable. Gray is sympathetic and funny and saucer-eyed--even, at times, unhinged. He wants to solve the unsolvable, and remarkably, for a famous cold case, his spadework turns up fresh material.</p> <p>As much as <em>Skyjack</em> is about D.B. Cooper, it is also a searing group portrait of those who even today find meaning in his mystery, a travelogue through a tumultuous era in American history, and a study of the paranoid style in American obsession. Most indelibly, it is an exploration of the mystery within the mystery, the puzzle of why these unfilled blank spots in our past have such a haunting grip on our imaginations.</p> <p></p><b>GEOFFREY GRAY</b> writes about crime, politics, sports, travel and food.

The theory was well rooted in exercise science--you burn a higher percentage of fat while exercising slowly and a higher percentage of carbohydrate as you speed up--but not very practical for most people. If you're only going to exercise for a half-hour a day, you burn a lot more calories by going fast than slow, regardless of how many of those calories come from fat.<p> Now Stu Mittleman, probably the foremost advocate of slow exercise, wants to reopen the argument. <i>Slow Burn</i> presents an entire lifestyle plan built around running slowly. He doesn't disagree with the idea that you can lose weight faster by training faster; he just thinks it's too stressful for the body to exercise that way.</p><p> Mittleman is one of the most famous long-distance runners in the world, and by long, we're talking <i>really</i> long: he once ran 571 miles in six days. So the program he outlines in <i>Slow Burn</i> shows you how to slow down and achieve more--an exercise plan that's less stressful to your body; a diet plan with less sugar and more healthy, unsaturated fats from fish and olive oil; and some tips about rethinking your everyday life to make it less stressful. (For example, he advocates the 85 percent rule: try to do everything the right way 85 percent of the time, and don't knock yourself out over the last 15 percent.) He also peppers the book with theories he's picked up from various branches of alternative medicine and nutrition--applied kinesiology, reflexology, and eating according to blood type. Mittleman's plan isn't for everyone. Certainly, if you like weight lifting or fast-paced sports like hockey and basketball, you won't find much to like here. But if you hate the pressure to always go faster, faster, faster, in life and in exercise, you'll find that Mittleman is on your side. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p><p>Stu Mittleman is a much-sought-after fitness educator whose clients include celebrities and business and community leaders as well as thousands of dedicated husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, who aspire to excellence in their health and vitality.

She tries to memorize everything about her home&#x2013;tall grass swaying to the rhythm of the breeze, determined mosquitoes, working bumblebees. There is a family party to say good-bye. Her father takes her out in a canoe and implores her to remember the trees, the water, and the mountains, and her grandmother gives her a small bag made of deer hide in which to keep her memories.

Ed Young lives in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.</p><p>Born and raised in New York City, Jane Yolen now lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts. She attended Smith College and received her master's degree in education from the University of Massachusetts. The distinguished author of more than 170 books, Jane Yolen is a person of many talents. When she is not writing, Yolen composes songs, is a professional storyteller on the stage, and is the busy wife of a university professor, the mother of three grown children, and a grandmother.<p>Active in several organizations, Yolen has been on the Board of Directors of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, was president of the Science Fiction Writers of America from 1986 to 1988, is on the editorial board of several magazines, and was a founding member of the Western New England Storytellers Guild, the Western Massachusetts Illustrators Guild, and the Bay State Writers Guild. For twenty years, she ran a monthly writer's workshop for new children's book authors. In 1980, when Yolen was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree by Our Lady of the Elms College in Chicopee, Massachusetts, the citation recognized that "throughout her writing career she has remained true to her primary source of inspiration--folk culture." Folklore is the "perfect second skin," writes Yolen. "From under its hide, we can see all the shimmering, shadowy uncertainties of the world." Folklore, she believes, is the universal human language, a language that children instinctively feel in their hearts.</p><p>All of Yolen's stories and poems are somehow rooted in her sense of family and self. <b>The Emperor and the Kite</b>, which was a Caldecott Honor Book in 1983 for its intricate papercut illustrations by Ed Young, was based on Yolen's relationship with her late father, who was an international kite-flying champion. <b>Owl Moon</b>, winner of the 1988 Caldecott Medal for John Schoenherr's exquisite watercolors, was inspired by her husband's interest in birding.</p><p>Yolen's graceful rhythms and outrageous rhymes have been gathered in numerous collections. She has earned many awards over the years: the Regina Medal, the Kerlan Award, the World Fantasy Award, the Society of Children's Book Writers Award, the Mythopoetic Society's Aslan Award, the Christopher Medal, the Boy's Club Jr. Book Award, the Garden State Children's Book Award, the Daedalus Award, a number of Parents' Choice Magazine Awards, and many more. Her books and stories have been translated into Japanese, French, Spanish, Chinese, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Afrikaans, !Xhosa, Portuguese, and Braille.</p><p>With a versatility that has led her to be called "America's Hans Christian Andersen," Yolen, the child of two writers, is a gifted and natural storyteller. Perhaps the best explanation for her outstanding accomplishments comes from Jane Yolen herself: "I don't care whether the story is real or fantastical. I tell the story that needs to be told."</p><p>copyright 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

Author David Ricardo, with Adam Smith, founded the "classical" system of political economy, a school of thought that dominated economic policies throughout the nineteenth century and figured prominently in the theories of John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx.<br>A friend and colleague of James Mill, Thomas Malthus, and Jeremy Bentham &#x2014; each of whom exercised a decided influence on his intellectual development &#x2014; Ricardo elevated economic theory to hitherto unprecedented levels of sophistication. His clear and consistent definition of the classical system included the foundation of the tenets of diminishing returns and economic rent, which led to the doctrines known today as distribution theory and international trade theory, or comparative advantage. The Ricardian system continues to influence and inform modern economic thought, and <i>The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</i> is essential reading for students of the social sciences.</p><p>David Ricardo became a stockbroker at the age of 21 and slowly became a recognized economic scholar in England.

That is because attachment styles can be changed, and this workbook's purpose is to help you on your path to do exactly that.

It includes letters, diaries, newspaper articles, oral histories, ancient myths, and accounts by travelers, traders, and missionaries who encountered the Cherokees from the 16th century to the present. Among the stories told by these &#x201c;voices&#x201d; are those of Rebecca Neugin being carried as a child on the Trail of Tears; Mary Stapler Ross seeing her beautiful Rose Cottage burned to the ground during the Civil War; Hannah Hicks watching as marauders steal her food and split open her feather beds, scattering the feathers in the wind; and girls at the Cherokee Female Seminary studying the same curriculum as women at Mount Holyoke. <em>Voices of Cherokee Women</em> recounts how Cherokee women went from having equality within the tribe to losing much of their political and economic power in the 19th century to regaining power in the 20th, as Joyce Dugan and Wilma Mankiller became the first female chiefs of the Cherokee Nation. The book&#x2019;s publication was timed for the commemoration of the 175th anniversary of the Trail of Tears.</p> <p>Carolyn Ross Johnston has a B.A. from Samford University and a Ph.D. in history from the University of California&#x2013;Berkeley.

In times of crisis, communities and members of organizations expect their leaders to minimize the impact, while critics and bureaucratic competitors make use of social media to blame incumbent rulers and their policies.

The small, lonely rock, known in sea charts by its Spanish name &#x201c;Isla de los Alcatraces,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Island of Pelicans,&#x201d; lay essentially dormant until the 1850s, when the military converted the island into a fortress to protect the booming San Francisco region. Alcatraz served as a pivotal military position until the early 20th century and in 1934 was converted into a federal penitentiary to house some of America&#x2019;s most incorrigible prisoners. The penitentiary closed in 1963, and Alcatraz joined the National Park Service system in 1972. Since then, it has remained a popular attraction as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.</p><p>Gregory L. Wellman, a member of the Wells Fargo Historical Services Department and the California Historical Society, reveals in these images the role of Alcatraz since 1853. The island&#x2019;s startling transformation comes alive through the photographic collections of the Alcatraz Alumni Association, the Golden Gate National Archives, and other private collections from around the country. This stirring imagery documents the evolution of one of America&#x2019;s most renowned and memorable landmarks.</p><h2>The Godfather Classic Quotes: A Classic Collection of Quotes from Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s, The Godfather</h2><p>Francis Ford Coppola&#x2019;s <i>The Godfather</i> is one of the greatest movies of all time and one of the most popular: on its 35th anniversary, it continues to be a top earner on video and DVD.

About the writing, I mean. Actually, I&#x2019;m nervous about the whole thing&#x2014;&#x2014;this whole adventure. But the writing . . . I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;ve never been trendy, so maybe that&#x2019;s why this is working for me now.

One post and I was sick of my online persona already. Who was this falsely cheery person? She sounded like she knew what she was doing.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s see what happens? More like &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s document the debacle.&#x201d; Or . . . &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have some kind of a record so that the police know where to look when I disappear on this ill-fated potential disaster.&#x201d;</p><p>My birthday is February 14. Which, this year, was yesterday. Now, when I was a kid, it was kind of a double-win. Cake, presents, and valentine chocolate all in one day? Total bonus.</p><p>But something changed as I got older. The first year of middle school, I was excited. I brought the usual bag filled with paper valentines to class, only to find some invisible force&#x2014;one that I could not hope to tap into&#x2014;had declared them uncool. High school was worse; and by the time I made it to my twenties, I began to face the day with something like dread. If I had a boyfriend at the time, it was usually fine. Still, out of the nine birthdays I have lived through in my twenties, I&#x2019;ve had a boyfriend for only two of them. I also had a husband for one, but that birthday was the worst of all.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Yesterday, I turned twenty-nine. No valentine chocolate. Three cards: a birthday card from my sister, one from my friend, Jazmin&#x2014;and a valentine from my bank. Apparently they&#x2019;d &#x201c;love&#x201d; to send me a new credit card at a reduced rate . . . &#x2019;specially for me.</p><p>As of yesterday, I also had a boss, who went ballistic when he found out I was adding free shots of chocolate to people&#x2019;s mochas in honor of the day.</p><p>I guess I should say . . . ex-boss.</p><p>Look, I know there must be other people in the same situation. Valentine&#x2019;s Day is a particularly lonely day to turn twenty-nine. It shouldn&#x2019;t be worse than having a birthday on Christmas, right? Statistically, at least 1/365th (which my calculator tells me is 0.00274 percent) of the world&#x2019;s population must at least have a chance of sharing my birthday. But it doesn&#x2019;t feel like it&#x2019;s the case at all.</p><p>What it feels like . . . is something has to change. Something big. I&#x2019;m not sure what this is going to look like. I&#x2019;m scared.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m going.</p><br><br><p>Fond Farewells . . .<br><br>7:45 p.m., February 16<br><br>Chicago, Illinois, USA</p><p><br>Saying good-bye is hard. My parents live down south, but I have siblings in the city. A sibling, anyway. But farewells are just part of a new adventure, right?</p><p>Right?</p><p>&#x2014;Emma S.</p><br><p>Comments: 0</p><br><p>My sister loves me. I&#x2019;m sure she does. But we come from practical stock: good, solid English grandparents, sensible and organized parents. She&#x2019;s true to her roots. My more&#x2014;ah&#x2014;unique ideas have never met with her approval.</p><p>The conversation we had earlier today did not go well.</p><p>&#x201c;Emma, you are completely, entirely, without-a-doubt, bat-shit crazy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not crazy. I just&#x2014; I just need to do this, Soph. I&#x2019;m not asking for your approval.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t get it if you were.&#x201d; She held up a finger. &#x201c;In the first place, you&#x2019;ve hardly been anywhere, and never on your own.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s high time I tried it, right?&#x201d;</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, pushed her chair back, and closed her office door. Behind the glass walls, sensible people buzzed by, doing sensible, salary-earning work, and living sensible lives. With Sophia that worked up, I was relieved I hadn&#x2019;t mentioned the whole searching-for-Jamie blog thing when I said I was leaving. No need to stir the pot even further.</p><p>Luckily, my sister is not an Internet time-waster. There are not, in her words, enough hours in the day to &#x201c;squander a single minute reading the uneducated drivel produced by people with too much time on their hands.&#x201d; All the better.</p><p>But I digress.</p><p>My sister is a broker. (Funny, really, considering I&#x2019;ve always been the broker one . . .) Sophia&#x2019;s position as CFO of Angst &amp; Argot was hard-won, and as a rule, she doesn&#x2019;t tolerate interruptions in her day. But when I&#x2019;d emailed her with my plans, she&#x2019;d called me immediately and insisted I stop by her office.</p><p>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she continued, perching on the corner of her desk in her Ann Taylor suit. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ve been struggling at work. And . . . I&#x2019;m sorry the thing with Egon didn&#x2019;t work out.&#x201d;</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sorry? You were against my relationship with Egon from the start. &#x2018;He&#x2019;s a graphic artist, Emma. He drinks lattes, for Christ&#x2019;s sake. And what kind of name is Egon, anyway? It&#x2019;s the name of a flake. He&#x2019;s nothing but a latte-drinking hipster-artist flake.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged and directed her gaze out at the thirty-eighth-floor vista. The Chicago skyline had the dark and lowering look it often has in February, reminding us resident mortals that winter isn&#x2019;t even half done with us yet. My sister blinked at me. &#x201c;All I&#x2019;m saying is that no matter how bad things are at home, it&#x2019;ll get better.&#x201d;</p><p>That made me snort. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not struggling with my sexuality here, Sophia. I&#x2019;m not suicidal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Egon was all wrong for you, Em. You just need to find the right man. If it&#x2019;s about a guy, why not try Internet dating again? Didn&#x2019;t you meet Egon online? You can find someone without leaving the country.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is not about a man,&#x201d; I said, waving my hand as dismissively as I could manage. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just going to leave town for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On a fool&#x2019;s errand. A journey to nowhere.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Scotland is not nowhere. It&#x2019;s a viable tourist destination.&#x201d;</p><p>It was her turn to make a disgusting nasal sound.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe in July. Take a look out there, Emma. It&#x2019;s the dead of winter, and we&#x2019;re in a civilized country. In Scotland, it&#x2019;ll be sleet and snow and no sun for six more months at least. If you&#x2019;re going to run away, why not head for the Caribbean? Maybe you&#x2019;ll meet a rich guy who&#x2019;ll make you forget all about Egon and his penchant for teenagers.&#x201d;</p><p>That was hard to take sitting down, so I stood up.</p><p>It was hard to take standing up, too, but by that time, I&#x2019;d at least thought of a response.</p><p>&#x201c;Tiffany&#x2019;s twenty, and he&#x2019;s welcome to her,&#x201d; I retorted. &#x201c;Anyway, the whole thing with Egon was over almost a year ago. And I don&#x2019;t want to go to the Caribbean for a fling. I&#x2019;m almost thirty. I&#x2019;m embracing my agency as a woman. I need to see if I can have an actual life experience.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia slammed her fist down on the desk. It looked like a gesture a CFO would make. I think maybe she&#x2019;d been practicing. &#x201c;I knew it! This idea has midlife crisis written all over it. Listen, Emma, what you should be doing right now is finding a decent job and solidifying your financial portfolio. You&#x2019;re halfway to retirement age. You can&#x2019;t start ticking things off your bucket list when you don&#x2019;t even own a bucket.&#x201d;</p><p>She was, of course, depressingly correct. Halfway to retirement, and I&#x2019;ve never even held a job that offered benefits. But I was disinclined to remind her of that fact; and anyway, there was no arguing with my sister when she was on a roll. That she&#x2019;s two years younger than I am didn&#x2019;t help, either.</p><p>So I began to nod&#x2014;and back away, slowly. &#x201c;Okay, Soph. I&#x2019;ll think about it, I swear.&#x201d;</p><p>Her phone rang, and she held up a hand. &#x201c;Wait a sec, I&#x2019;ll just put this on hold. Sophia Sheridan, here&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>But as soon as she picked up the phone, I waved back, smiled apologetically, gave her the universal finger-thumb gesture that I would call her&#x2014;and bolted.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t need to know that I hadn&#x2019;t exactly quit my job. Or that I was in the process of selling everything I owned.</p><br><br><p>Feeling Fine . . .<br><br>1:00 a.m., February 17<br><br>Chicago, Illinois, USA</p><br><p>Warm family good-byes are behind me, and preparations for the trip are well under way.

I&#x2019;d wakened in the morning after a night spent alternately panicking between &#x201c;Oh my god! What have I done?&#x201d; and trying to remember how to attain Savasana. Since I&#x2019;d attended my last yoga class when I was twenty-three, mostly the panic won.</p><p>In the end, I decided the best way to combat panic was action, so I dragged myself out of bed and headed downtown to have business cards printed up. Nothing says &#x201c;Take Me Seriously&#x201d; like a business card, right? By the time I got downtown, I&#x2019;d decided on a design in my head and everything, but I spent a long time looking at the various fonts and so on to make sure it was perfect. When I placed the order, it seemed insane to have more than about twenty done, but the printers had a special deal for a hundred and fifty at half price, so I went for it.</p><p><br><br>FINDINGFRASER.COM<br><br>a blog<br><br>by EMMA SHERIDAN</p><br><p>A couple of hours later, when I picked them up, I realized I had forgotten to specify any contact information on the cards. They were beautiful, all right. A creamy off-white with raised print and a serious-feeling heft to them. But no number. No email address.</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t such a bad thing. My cell phone plan was ending in a week or so, anyway, and I wanted people to reach me through the blog. But&#x2014;looking at those cards&#x2014;god, things suddenly seemed so real.</p><p>So serious.</p><p>I hurried home before panic had me raving in the streets.</p><p><br>***</p><p>By noon I was lying on my back on my apartment floor, breathing into a fishy-smelling paper bag rescued from an old lunch I&#x2019;d somehow forgotten in the back of the fridge. Which had never happened to me before. I cannot recall missing a meal for any reason since I had my tonsils removed when I was seven. It clearly speaks to the unsettled nature of my mind. Or maybe the fact it was tuna on rye. I really hate tuna.</p><p>I would have tried elevating my feet on the couch, but the guys from Goodwill had come and taken it away. The removal of the couch made it seem like everything was happening so fast, and the paper bag just wasn&#x2019;t cutting it; so I thought, Fuck it, and drank the last of the Chablis in the fridge. It was early, I knew, but I&#x2019;d have to clean out the fridge at some point, right? Good enough reason on its own. Besides, the wine was in a box. Juice comes in a box, and people drink juice at two in the afternoon all the time.</p><p>Right?</p><br><p>***</p><p><br>The paper bag smelled like tuna, okay? And there&#x2019;s a reason I hate tuna. All fish, really.</p><p>I haven&#x2019;t always hated fish. Barbecued salmon. Golden-fried halibut. Even oysters in the half-shell. Used to love &#x2019;em all.</p><p>Not anymore. I lay on the floor beside the empty Chablis box and remembered . . .</p><br><p>***</p><br><p>The old clock by the front door had chimed eight that night as I set the shrimp cocktail on the table. It was our first anniversary and I was determined to do it right. A veritable feast was lined up, ready to serve after the shrimp: creamy clam chowder to start, pan-fried trout for the main course, and an enormous chocolate torte for dessert.</p><p>Egon showed up at eight fifteen with a pink posy in one hand&#x2014;and his assistant, Tiffany, in the other. &#x201c;Tiff&#x2019;s fridge broke down today,&#x201d; he said, setting the wilted flower in the center of the table.</p><p>Tiffany wriggled between Egon and the table. &#x201c;Oh, Emma, you are so kind to include me,&#x201d; she gushed. &#x201c;I swore I wouldn&#x2019;t disturb your special night with Egon, but he insisted you&#x2019;d put on an enormous spread and I wouldn&#x2019;t be in the way.&#x201d;</p><p>That girl sucked those shrimp back like a Dyson. Egon had smiled indulgently and pushed the plate closer to her.</p><p>In retrospect, perhaps I should have taken the three of us eating our anniversary dinner as a sign. Because within six months, Tiffany was serving all-you-can-eat lobster dinners for two in my old apartment, and I haven&#x2019;t eaten seafood since.</p><p>Strangely, though, the break-up dinner didn&#x2019;t affect my feelings for chocolate tortes.</p><br><p>***</p><br><p>So, yeah, I&#x2019;d sworn to Sophia my plan wasn&#x2019;t about a man. Egon had cured me of Internet dating for life, but that didn&#x2019;t mean I didn&#x2019;t have a few good memories. Still, by three, the crying jag brought on by the old Chablis and the pictures of Egon on the mantle that I&#x2019;d drunkenly begun to pack was over.</p><p>The crying was over, and so were the pictures.</p><p>Over the balcony railing, as a matter of fact.</p><p>That shattering noise glass makes on pavement?</p><p>Extremely satisfying.</p><p>I finished sweeping the entire parking lot free of glass by five thirty.

As servers dressed in rodent costumes and wearing white gloves offer elegant finger sandwiches and fine teas, Theo learns these parties date back to early twentieth-century Charleston to promote better public health.<br><br>But this party goes from odd to chaotic when a fire starts at one of the tables and Doreen's entrepreneur husband suddenly goes into convulsions and drops dead. Has his favorite orange pekoe tea been poisoned? Theo smells a rat. And as she reviews the guest list for suspects, she soon finds herself drawn into in a dangerous game of cat and mouse...</p><p><b>Laura Childs</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Tea Shop Mysteries, Scrapbooking Mysteries, and Cackleberry Club Mysteries. In her previous life she was CEO of her own marketing firm, authored several screenplays, and produced a reality TV show.<p>1</p><p>Palmettos swayed lazily in the soft breeze, daffodils bobbed their shaggy heads as Theodosia Browning stepped quickly along the brick pathway that wound through a bountiful front yard garden and up to the polished double doors of the Calhoun Mansion. Pausing, she pulled back the enormous brass boar&#x2019;s head door knocker&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing wimpy about this place&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and let it crash against the metal plate.</p><p><i>Claaaang.</i> The sound echoed deep within the house as the boar&#x2019;s eyes glittered and glared at her.</p><p>Turning to face Drayton, her friend and tea sommelier, Theodosia said, &#x201c;This should be fun. I&#x2019;ve never visited Doreen&#x2019;s home before.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll like it,&#x201d; Drayton said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a grand old place. Built back in the early eighteen hundreds by Emerson Calhoun, one of Charleston&#x2019;s early indigo barons.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;re lucky to be invited then,&#x201d; she said. Their hostess, Doreen Briggs, also known to her close friends as &#x201c;Dolly,&#x201d; was president of the Ladies Opera Auxiliary and one of the leading social powerhouses in Charleston, South Carolina. Theodosia had always thought of Doreen as being slightly bubbleheaded, but that could be a carefully cultivated act, aimed to deflect from all the philanthropic work that she and her husband were involved in.</p><p>A few seconds later, the front door creaked open and Theodosia and Drayton were greeted by a vision so strange it could have been a drug-induced hookah dream straight out of <i>Alice in</i> <i>Wonderland</i>. The man who answered the door was dressed in a powder blue velvet waistcoat, cream-colored slacks, and spit-polished black buckle boots. But it wasn&#x2019;t his formal, quasi-Edwardian attire that made him so bizarre. It was the giant white velvet rat head perched atop his head and shoulders. Yes, white velvet, just like the fur of a properly groomed, semi-dandy white rat. Complete with round ears, long snout bristling with whiskers, and bright pink eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Welcome,&#x201d; the rat said to them as he placed one white-gloved hand (paw?) behind his back and bowed deeply.</p><p>At which point Theodosia arched her carefully waxed brows and said, as a not-so-subtle aside to Drayton, &#x201c;When the invitation specified a &#x2018;Charleston rat tea,&#x2019; they weren&#x2019;t just whistling Dixie.&#x201d;</p><p>It <i>was</i> a rat tea. Of sorts. Drayton had filled her in on the history of the quaint rat tea custom on their stroll over from the Indigo Tea Shop, where they brewed all manner of tea, fed and charmed customers, and made a fairly comfortable living.</p><p>&#x201c;Seventy-five years ago,&#x201d; Drayton said, &#x201c;rat teas were all the rage in Charleston. You see, at the advent of World War Two, our fair city underwent a tremendous population explosion as war workers arrived at the navy shipyard in droves.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I get that,&#x201d; Theodosia had said. &#x201c;But what&#x2019;s with the rats specifically?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; Drayton said. &#x201c;With the increased populace, downtown merchants were thriving. Because they were so franticly busy, they began tossing their garbage out onto the sidewalks, which immediately attracted a huge influx of rats. The local public health officials, fearing some kind of ghastly epidemic, quickly spearheaded a &#x2018;rat torpedo&#x2019; campaign. Volunteers were tasked with wrapping poisoned bait in small folded bits of newspaper and sticking them in alleys and crawl spaces.&#x201d;</p><p>Theodosia listened, fascinated, as Drayton continued his story.</p><p>&#x201c;These rat torpedoes were so effective,&#x201d; Drayton said, &#x201c;that prominent society ladies even held fancy &#x2018;rat teas&#x2019; to help promote the campaign.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the rats were eventually eradicated?&#x201d; Theodosia had asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Charleston became a public health model,&#x201d; Drayton said. &#x201c;Several major cities even sent representatives to study our method.&#x201d;</p><p>The blue rat at the door was still nodding to them as Theodosia and Drayton stepped inside the foyer. Here, they were greeted by a second rat wearing a pastel pink coat. This rat was equally polite.</p><p>&#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; pink rat said.</p><p>&#x201c;I feel like I&#x2019;ve been drinking to excess,&#x201d; Theodosia said. &#x201c;Seeing pink rats instead of pink elephants.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This way, please,&#x201d; pink rat said to them in carefully modulated tones.</p><p>They followed him down a long, red-tiled hallway where oil paintings dark with crackle glaze hung on the walls and the hum of conversation grew louder with each step they took. Then pink rat turned suddenly and ushered them into an enormous sunlit parlor where fifty or so guests milled about and a half-dozen elegant tea tables were carefully arranged.</p><p>Pink rat consulted his clipboard. &#x201c;Miss Browning, Mr. Conneley, you&#x2019;re both to be seated at table six.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Drayton said.</p><p>&#x201c;Do I know you?&#x201d; Theodosia asked pink rat. Her blue eyes sparkled with curiosity and her voice was slightly teasing. She was a woman of rare and fair beauty even though she&#x2019;d be the first to pooh-pooh anyone who told her so. But with her masses of auburn hair, English rose complexion, and captivating smile, she certainly stood out in a crowd.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; pink rat said as he spun on the heels of his buckle boots and hastened off to escort another group of guests to their table.</p><p>&#x201c;Who <i>was</i> that?&#x201d; Theodosia asked as her eyes skittered around the rather grand room, taking in the crystal chandelier, enormous marble fireplace, gaggle of upscale-looking guests, as well as tea tables set with Wedgwood china and Reed &amp; Barton silver. &#x201c;He sounded so familiar. The rat guy, I mean.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No idea,&#x201d; Drayton said as he regarded the table settings. &#x201c;But isn&#x2019;t this lovely? And what fun to stage a madcap homage to the rat teas of yesteryear.&#x201d; Drayton was beginning to rhapsodize, one of the most endearing qualities of this debonair, sixty-something tea sommelier, while Theodosia was suddenly fizzing with curiosity. Why had she been invited when she had just a nodding acquaintance with Doreen Briggs? And who were these white rat butlers, anyway? Professional servers shanghaied from a local catering company? Or actors who&#x2019;d been hired to wear costumes and playact a rather bizarre role?</p><p>These were the kind of things Theodosia wondered about. These were the things that kept her brain whirring at night when she should have been fast asleep.</p><p>&#x201c;Drayton!&#x201d; an excited voice shrilled. Theodosia and Drayton turned to find Doreen Briggs closing on them like a five-foot-two-inch heat-seeking missile. She charged up to Drayton, rose on tiptoes to administer a profusion of air kisses, and then flashed an enormous smile at Theodosia. &#x201c;Theodosia, she said. &#x201c;So good of you to come.&#x201d; Doreen gripped her hand firmly, pumped her arm. &#x201c;Welcome to my home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for inviting me,&#x201d; Theodosia said. &#x201c;And I must say, you have a very lovely home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is cozy, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Doreen said. Her green eyes glinted almost coquettishly, her reddish-blond hair cascaded around her face in a forest of curls that didn&#x2019;t seem quite natural for a woman in her late fifties.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re thrilled to be here,&#x201d; Drayton added.</p><p>Doreen, who was stuffed into a pastel pink shantung silk dress with a rope of pearls around her neck, waved a hand that was festooned with sparkling diamond rings, and said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think this is jolly fun? The rat tea theme, I mean? Aren&#x2019;t my liveried rats just adorable?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Charming,&#x201d; Theodosia responded. Truthfully, she thought the rats&#x2014;she&#x2019;d seen at least four of them chugging officiously around the room&#x2014;were a little strange. But this was a woman who supported the arts, gave money to service dog organizations, and was on the verge of bequeathing a sizable grant to Drayton&#x2019;s beloved Heritage Society, so she was willing to cut her a good deal of slack.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Beau?&#x201d; Drayton asked. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s certainly here today, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; Beau Briggs was Doreen&#x2019;s husband, a self-professed entrepreneur who owned apartment buildings in North Charleston and was a partner in the newly opened Gilded Magnolia Spa on King Street.</p><p>Doreen pushed back a strand of frizzled hair. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s around here somewhere. Probably bending the ear of one of our guests, talking about one of his pet business projects.&#x201d; She put a hand on Theodosia&#x2019;s arm and said, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it cute when men work themselves into a tizzy over business? I love how they think they&#x2019;re masters of the universe when it&#x2019;s really we women who run things.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And a fine job you ladies do,&#x201d; Drayton said.</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you the most politically correct gentleman yet,&#x201d; Doreen fawned. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to indoctrinate Beau with some of your fine, liberal ideas.&#x201d; She managed a quick sip of air and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re sitting right here.&#x201d; Then she waved a chubby hand. &#x201c;Your table is right next to us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking forward to meeting your husband,&#x201d; Theodosia said. She&#x2019;d heard so much about the man who&#x2019;d helped create Gilded Magnolia Spa. Magazines had run full-color spreads, health and beauty editors had rhapsodized about it in articles, and the ladies-who-lunch types, who shopped at Bob Ellis Shoes and Hampden Clothing, had been exchanging whispers about the spa&#x2019;s gold foil facials and amazing electrostim lifts.</p><p>&#x201c;I imagine Beau will pop up any moment,&#x201d; Doreen said as she glanced around the room. Then her face lit up and she cried, &#x201c;There he is.&#x201d; She waved a hand as bracelets clanked. &#x201c;Beau!&#x201d; Her voice rose higher. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m talking to you, hunky monkey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who do you <i>think</i> I&#x2019;m waving at like a crazy lady? Get over here and say hello to Theodosia and Drayton.&#x201d;</p><p>Beau Briggs, who was forty pounds overweight, with slicked-back red hair, the jowls of a shar-pei, and perfectly steam-cleaned pores, came huffing over to join them.</p><p>&#x201c;Dolly,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; His pink sport coat was stretched around his midsection, the gold buttons looking about ready to burst and go airborne. Theodosia decided Beau might partake of his own spa&#x2019;s skin care regimen, but not their low-cal smoothies and fruit salads.</p><p>&#x201c;These are the people I was telling you about,&#x201d; Doreen said. &#x201c;Theodosia and Drayton. They run that lovely Indigo Tea Shop over on Church Street. You remember, they bake those chocolate chip scones that you adore so much?&#x201d;</p><p>Beau turned an expectant smile on them. &#x201c;I hope you brought some along?&#x201d;</p><p>Doreen gave him a playful slap. &#x201c;Silly boy. You know our caterers are handling the scones and tea sandwiches today. Theodosia and Drayton are our guests. They&#x2019;re here to partake of tea, not serve it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A respite,&#x201d; Drayton said, trying to be jocular.</p><p>&#x201c;Then sit down, sit down,&#x201d; Doreen said as all around them guests began taking their seats. &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; She spun around to position herself at the head table, all the while looking a little scattered. &#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s high time I get this fancy tea started.&#x201d; She glanced down, looking slightly perturbed. &#x201c;Now, where did I put my silver bell?&#x201d;</p><p>The tea turned out to be a lovely affair, albeit a trifle strange. The rat theme continued as everyone took their places and more liveried rats came scurrying out of the kitchen. They carried steaming teapots in white-gloved hands, pouring out servings of Darjeeling and Assam tea. By the time silver trays overflowing with cinnamon and lemon poppy seed scones arrived, Theodosia was well past her initial surprise. In fact, she was able to sit back and enjoy herself as Drayton did the heavy lifting, chatting merrily with all the guests as their table, most of whom she had only a nodding acquaintance with. Then again, Drayton was a stickler for politeness and decorum. And tended to be a lot more social than she was.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s see now, Theodosia thought after they&#x2019;d gone around the table and made hasty introductions. The two blondes, Dree and Diana, were on the board of directors for the Charleston Symphony. The woman in the fire-engine red suit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Twilby&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Eleanor Twilby?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was the executive director of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something. And then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, she just wasn&#x2019;t sure. But the crab and Gruy�re cheese quiche she was digging into was incredibly creamy and delicious.</p><p>Doreen turned in her chair and tapped Theodosia on the shoulder. &#x201c;Having fun?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>Theodosia, caught with a bite of food in her mouth, chewed quickly and swallowed. &#x201c;This quiche is incredible!&#x201d; She really meant it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to get the recipe. Haley would love it.&#x201d; Haley was her chef and chief baker back at the Indigo Tea Shop.</p><p>&#x201c;Carolina blue crab,&#x201d; Doreen said in a conspiratorial whisper. &#x201c;From a caterer that&#x2019;s brand-new here in Charleston and making quite a splash. We even tapped them to cater all the appetizers for our grand opening party at Gilded Magnolia Spa next Saturday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have quite a large group here today,&#x201d; Theodosia said. &#x201c;Are most of them spa customers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a sprinkling of all sorts of people,&#x201d; Doreen said. &#x201c;Spa members, media people, a few friends and neighbors, some business associates.&#x201d; She raised a hand to one of the rat waiters and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to need a fresh pot of this orange pekoe tea for Beau.&#x201d; And to Theodosia: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s his favorite.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of Drayton&#x2019;s recommendations?&#x201d; Theodosia asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, absolutely,&#x201d; Doreen said. &#x201c;I consulted with Drayton on all the teas we&#x2019;re serving here today. As usual, he was spot-on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the best tea sommelier I&#x2019;ve ever encountered. We&#x2019;re fortunate to have him at the Indigo Tea Shop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Watch out someone doesn&#x2019;t try to steal him away,&#x201d; Doreen said. She turned, held up Beau&#x2019;s teacup for the waiter to pour him a fresh cup of tea, and said, &#x201c;Just set the teapot on the warmer, please.&#x201d;</p><p>The pink rat leaned forward, set down the teapot, and, in the process, the edge of his sleeve brushed against one of the tall white tapers.</p><p>&#x201c;Watch the!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Doreen cried out as the candle wobbled dangerously in its silver holder.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The burning candle bobbled and swayed for a couple more seconds and then tipped onto the table. It landed, flame burning bright, right in the middle of an enormous, frothy centerpiece. As if someone had doused it with gasoline, a ring of dancing fire burst forth. A split second later, the decorator-done arrangement of silk flowers, pinecones, twisted vines, and dried moss was a boiling, seething inferno.</p><p>As the guests at Doreen&#x2019;s table began to scream, two people leapt to their feet and began beating at the crackling flames with linen napkins. Their efforts just served to fan the flames and set one of the napkins on fire. It twisted and blazed like an impromptu torch until the person waving it suddenly dropped it onto the table.</p><p>Beau Briggs, as if just realizing they might all be in mortal danger, suddenly jumped to his feet, knocking his chair over backward. &#x201c;Somebody get a fire extinguisher!&#x201d; he yelped as flames continued to dance and scorch the tabletop. Now everyone from his table was jigging around in a fearful, nervous rugbylike scrum, while people from other tables were rushing over to shout suggestions. Doreen, no help at all, put her hands on her head and let loose a series of high-pitched yips.</p><p>&#x201c;Somebody do something!&#x201d; a woman in a black leather dress screamed.</p><p>At which point Theodosia grabbed the teapot from her table, elbowed her way through the gaggle of guests, and poured the tea directly onto the flames.</p><p>There was a loud ...</p></p><h2>Confessions of a Public Speaker</h2><p><p>In this hilarious and highly practical book, author and professional speaker Scott Berkun reveals the techniques behind what great communicators do, and shows how anyone can learn to use them well.

Emphasis is placed on the development of physically coherent and mathematically clear characterizations of the scientific and technological foundations of fusion energy which are specifically suitable for a first course on the subject. Of interest, therefore, are selected aspects of nuclear physics, electromagnetics, plasma physics, reaction dynamics, materials science, and engineering systems, all brought together to form an integrated perspective on nuclear fusion and its practical utilization. The book identifies several distinct themes. The first is concerned with preliminary and introductory topics which relate to the basic and relevant physical processes associated with nuclear fusion. Then, the authors undertake an analysis of magnetically confined, inertially confined, and low-temperature fusion energy concepts. Subsequently, they introduce the important blanket domains surrounding the fusion core and discuss synergetic fusion-fission systems. Finally, they consider selected conceptual and technological subjects germane to the continuing development of fusion energy systems.</p><p>"Provides a useful summary of relevant physics, an objective overview of possible systems that could allow and contain thermonuclear fusion." -- <i>CERN Courier, 2002</i></p><h2>Common Factors in Couple and Family Therapy: The Overlooked Foundation for Effective Practice</h2><p>Grounded in theory, research, and extensive clinical experience, this pragmatic book addresses critical questions of how change occurs in couple and family therapy and how to help clients achieve better results. The authors show that regardless of a clinician&#39;s orientation or favored techniques, there are particular therapist attributes, relationship variables, and other factors that make therapy--specifically, therapy with couples and families--effective. The book explains these common factors in depth and provides hands-on guidance for capitalizing on them in clinical practice and training. User-friendly features include numerous case examples and a reproducible common factors checklist.</p><p>Douglas H.

As the number of available modalities grows with each passing day, students, clinicians, and researchers will find the paradigm presented here to be extremely useful in isolating what is specifically responsible for change and figuring out how to incorporate it into doing what we do best. A 'must read.'"--Frank M. Dattilio, PhD, ABPP, Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine<br> &nbsp;<br> "A long-awaited, critically important contribution. The authors offer a guidebook for understanding and integrating the common factors that cut across distinct therapies, and also present an extraordinarily thoughtful and nonpolemical examination of the strengths and weaknesses of the common factors strategy. This book will help advanced therapists better understand and sharpen what they do; will help intermediate and beginning-level therapists discover and utilize potent common factors that will enhance their effectiveness; will help theorists cast their ideas in a more generic and universally accessible language; and will help researchers integrate common factors into their hypotheses and research designs. A huge step ahead for our field--read it."--William M. Pinsof, PhD, private practice, Chicago, Illinois<br><br> "Countering the stampede to find the best model--or silver bullet--for therapeutic change, Sprenkle, Davis, and Lebow, seasoned researchers and practitioners, draw out the common elements across models that facilitate effective change. Since no single model can best fit the broad diversity of clients and challenges in our complex and uncertain world, their practical approach is especially valuable for clinical training and practice."--Froma Walsh, MSW, PhD, Mose and Sylvia Firestone Professor Emerita, School of Social Service Administration and Department of Psychiatry, University of Chicago, and Codirector, Chicago Center for Family Health<br><br> "The best antidote yet to technique-heavy approaches to couple and family therapy. This book restores appropriate attention to the role and the person of the therapist, and urges therapeutic flexibility and creativity. It is 'must' reading for anyone engaged in learning about systems-oriented therapy or teaching and supervising couple and family therapists."--Alan S. Gurman, PhD, Department of Psychiatry (Emeritus), University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health<br><br> "Using research as a guide, the authors identify the critical skills that therapists need to be effective. This book is an excellent text for practicum classes in training programs because it helps novice therapists identify the critical skills they need regardless of their supervisor, clients, clinical site, and other variables that influence their training."--JoEllen Patterson, PhD, Marital and Family Therapy Program, University of San Diego<br><br>"[Uses] well-written and accessible case examples, and provide[s] enough of an overview so that readers unfamiliar with either CBT or common factors will be able to benefit....Well-written, easy to read, and make[s] good use of clinical vignettes and case studies to illustrate concepts....Written for clinicians, although researchers new to either CBT or common factors would benefit from the thorough content.

Cedric Gibbons was the supervisor in charge of the art department at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studios from its inception in 1924 until Gibbons chose to retire in 1956. Lavishly illustrated with over 175 pristine duotone photographs, the vast majority of which have never before been published, this is the first volume to trace Gibbons&#x2019; trendsetting career. At its height in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Gibbons was regularly acknowledged by his peers as having shaped the craft of art direction in American film; his work was recognized as representing the finest in motion picture sets and settings. Gibbons and his associates constructed the villages, towns, streets, squares and edifices that later appeared in hundreds of films, and whose mixed architecture stood in for army camps and the wild west, Dutch New York and Dickensian London, ancient China and modern Japan. Inspired by the work of Le Corbusier and the Bauhaus masters, as well as the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts D�coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris and Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s experiments with open planning, Gibbons championed the notion that movie decor should move beyond the commercial framework of the popular cinema</p><p>Howard Gutner first became interested in the Hollywood studio system and its traditional blend of business and art while attending the film studies program at Northwestern University. In 2001 he published Gowns by Adrian: The MGM Years 1928-1941. (Harry N. Abrams). This book was the first comprehensive review of Adrian&#x2019;s career at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was lauded by the New York Times as &#x201c;a definitive look at Hollywood&#x2019;s legendary designer.&#x201d; Gutner lives in Brooklyn, New York."As befitting its subject, MGM Style: Cedric Gibbons and the Art of the Golden Age of Hollywood is a class act.

Lenten disciplines become the spiritual equivalent of New Year's resolutions to lose weight, be healthier, or practice better money management. These promises are easily made and often quickly broken, leaving us feeling like we do not measure up to what we should be.<p> In his letter to the Philippians, the apostle Paul joyfully turns to spiritual practices that draw him closer to God amid persecution and imprisonment. These practices keep Paul connected to a sense of God's power and presence. Joy flows from Paul and becomes a vital part of his relationship with the Philippians.</p><p> <i>Because of This I Rejoice</i> is a 6-week study of Philippians that explores what Paul teaches about joyfully practicing spiritual disciplines. The intent of these disciplines is to help us focus less on ourselves and more on God. This Lenten study invites us to engage in the same spiritual practices as a way to grow closer to God and allow joy to flow through our lives.</p><p></p></p><p>Max O.

He eats everything in sight: his bowl, toy trains, the dining-room table, the fence, and the back porch. His owners, a vet, and two dog trainers are all incapable of stopping the pup's destructive behavior. Just when it looks as though the family will have to find a new home for their pet, he suddenly outgrows his nasty need to nibble. "He's not a puppy anymore," father proudly explains, while a 13-man construction crew works to repair the damaged house. Humorous colored-pencil cartoons reveal the devastation caused by the wee pooch and the family's reactions to the chaos left in his wake. Chewy Louie's exuberance is almost palpable and his teeth marks are everywhere. He's depicted as a small black dog with a pink tongue hanging out one end while his other end wags so vigorously that he appears to have multiple tails. Readers are left with the tiniest doubt about Louie's newfound maturity upon discovering that a corner of the last page has been chewed off. An entertaining tale about an all-too-common situation.<br><i>Maryann H. Owen, Racine Public Library, WI </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc."Chewy" Louie spreads destruction in the wake of his chomping teeth. At first he is content to chew on his bowl and toys, but as he grows, he begins to take bites out of everything, including the family car and the house. The efforts of two trainers fail to change his ways; peace doesn't come to the family until Louie grows up. Schneider's bright, cartoonlike colored-pencil illustrations perfectly capture Louie's manic energy and the text's exaggerated humor, especially the bafflement of the book's narrator, the little boy in Louie's beleaguered family. A goofy tale with a lot of kid appeal. <i>Todd Morning</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Here is a primer on bibliology, hermeneutics, and pedagogy that does not mention the words!

The status of behavioral and counseling therapies, EEG biofeedback, homeopathy, bodywork, energy medicine, and Chinese medicine as approaches are explored. <br><br>Author Sheila Rogers DeMare discusses a range of categories of tics including spasmodic facial movements, eye blinking, mild sounds and vocalizations.

Explaining the distinctive attainment of Tibetan Buddhist civilization as "the vivid sense of Buddhas in ordinary, daily reality," Thurman guides readers through selections that speak to the possibility of liberation for all beings. Stressing also the importance of the teacher or mentor figure in Tibetan Buddhist practice, he presents key texts from teachers whose words serve as inspiration to those seeking the path toward enlightenment. Excerpts culled from the vastness of the Tibetan canon include the hymns to the liberator goddess Tara, pieces from <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, writings on mentor worship from the first Panchen Lama, and selections from esoteric tantric practice texts. The volume ends with the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize lecture by Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, illustrating the enduring relevance of this ancient wisdom for modern life. <i>--Uma Kukathas</i>From the foremost Western Tibetan Buddhist scholar--and the first American Tibetan Buddhist monk--comes a comprehensive essential guide to the incomparable riches of Tibetan Buddhism.</p><h2>Conclave: A novel</h2><p><b>The best-selling author of <i>Enigma</i> and <i>Fatherland</i> turns to today's Vatican in a ripped-from-the-headlines novel, and gives us his most ambitious, page-turning thriller yet--where the power of God is nearly equaled by the ambition of men.</b> <br><br>The pope is dead.

Lomeli opened his eyes. He was curled up on his side. He felt groggy, raw. He had no idea how long he had been asleep, only that it couldn&#x2019;t have been for more than an hour or two. The sudden remembrance of all he had to do in the coming day passed over him like a wave of nausea, and for a while he lay unable to move. Normally his waking routine was to meditate for fifteen minutes then rise and say his morning prayers. But on this occasion, when at last he managed to summon the will to put his feet to the floor, he went directly into the bathroom and ran a shower as hot as he could bear. The water scourged his back and shoulders. He twisted and turned beneath it and cried out in pain. Afterwards he rubbed away the moisture on the mirror and surveyed with disgust his raw and scalded skin. <i>My body is clay, my good fame a vapour, my end is ashes.</i> <br><br> He felt too tense to breakfast with the others. He stayed in his room, rehearsing his homily and attempting to pray, and left it until the very last minute to go downstairs. <br><br> The lobby was a red sea of cardinals robing for the short procession to St. Peter&#x2019;s. The officials of the Conclave, led by Archbishop Mandorff and Monsignor O&#x2019;Malley, had been allowed back into the hostel to assist; Father Zanetti was waiting at the foot of the stairs to help Lomeli dress. They went into the&nbsp;same waiting room opposite the chapel in which he had met Wo&#x17a;niak the night before. When Zanetti asked him how he had slept, he replied, &#x201c;Very soundly, thank you,&#x201d; and hoped the young priest would not notice the dark circles beneath his eyes and the way his hands shook when he handed him his sermon for safe keeping. He ducked his head into the opening of the thick red chasuble that had been worn by successive Deans of the College over the past twenty years and held out his arms as Zanetti fussed around him like a tailor, straightening and adjusting it. The mantle felt heavy on his shoulders. He prayed silently:<i> Lord, who hast said, My yoke is easy and My burden is light, grant that I may so bear it as to attain Thy grace. Amen. Zanetti stood in front of him and reached up to place upon</i></p><p> Zanetti stood in front of him and reached up to place upon his head the tall mitre of white watered silk. The priest stepped back a pace to check it was correctly aligned, squinted, came forward again and altered it by a millimetre, then walked behind Lomeli and tugged down the ribbons at the back and smoothed them. It felt alarmingly precarious. Finally he gave him the crozier. Lomeli lifted the golden shepherd&#x2019;s crook a couple of times in his left hand, testing the weight. <i>You are not a shepherd</i>, a familiar voice whispered in his head. <i>You are a manager.</i> He had a sudden urge to give it back, to tear off the vestments, to confess himself a fraud and disappear. He smiled and nodded. &#x201c;It feels good,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br> Just before 10 a.m., the cardinals began moving off from the Casa Santa Marta, walking out of the plate-glass doors in pairs, in order of seniority, checked off by O&#x2019;Malley on his clipboard. Lomeli, resting on the crozier, waited with Zanetti and Mandorff beside the reception desk. They had been joined by Mandorff&#x2019;s deputy, the Dean of the Master of Papal Ceremonies, a cheerful, tubby Italian monsignor named Epifano, who would be his chief assistant during the Mass. Lomeli spoke to no one,&nbsp;looked at no one. He was still trying vainly to clear a space in his mind for God. <i>Eternal Trinity, I intend by Your grace to celebrate Mass to Your glory, and for the benefit of all, both living and dead, for whom Christ died, and to apply the ministerial fruit for the choosing of a new Pope . . .</i><br><br> At last they stepped out into the blank November morning. The double file of scarlet-robed cardinals stretched ahead of him across the cobbles towards the Arch of the Bells, where they disappeared into the basilica. Again the helicopter hovered somewhere nearby; again the faint sounds of demonstrators carried on the cold air. Lomeli tried to shut out all distractions, but it was impossible. Every twenty paces stood security men who bowed their heads as he passed and blessed them. He walked with his supporters beneath the arch, across the piazza dedicated to the early martyrs, along the portico of the basilica, through the massive bronze door and into the brilliant illumination of St. Peter&#x2019;s, lit for the television cameras, where a congregation of twenty thousand was waiting. He could hear the chanting of the choir beneath the dome and the vast echoing rustle of the multitude. The procession halted. He kept his eyes fixed straight ahead, willing stillness, conscious of the immense throng standing close-packed all around him&#x2014;nuns and priests and lay clergy, staring at him, whispering, smiling.<br><br><i> Eternal Trinity, I intend by Your grace to celebrate Mass to Your glory . . .</i><br><br> After a couple of minutes, they moved on again, up the wide central aisle of the nave. He glanced from side to side, leaning on the crozier with his left hand, motioning vaguely with his right, conferring his blessing upon the blur of faces. He glimpsed himself on a giant TV screen&#x2014;an erect, elaborately costumed, expressionless figure, walking as if in a trance. Who&nbsp;was this puppet, this hollow man? He felt entirely disembodied, as though he were floating alongside himself.<br><br> At the end of the aisle, where the nave gave on to the cupola of the dome, they had to pause beside Bernini&#x2019;s statue of St. Longinus, close to where the choir was singing, and wait while the last few pairs of cardinals filed up the steps to kiss the central altar and descended again. Only when this elaborate manoeuvre had been completed was Lomeli himself cleared to walk around to the rear of the altar. He bowed towards it. Epifano stepped forward and took away the crozier and gave it to an altar boy. Then he lifted the mitre from Lomeli&#x2019;s head, folded it, and handed it to a second acolyte. Out of habit, Lomeli touched his skullcap to check it was in place.<br><br> Together he and Epifano climbed the seven wide carpeted steps to the altar. Lomeli bowed again and kissed the white cloth. He straightened and rolled back the sleeves of his chasuble as if he were about to wash his hands. He took the silver thurible of burning coals and incense from its bearer and swung it by its chain over the altar&#x2014;seven times on this side, and then, walking round, a separate censing on each of the other three. The sweet-smelling smoke evoked feelings beyond memory. Out of the corner of his eye he saw dark-suited figures moving his throne into position. He gave back the thurible, bowed again and allowed himself to be conducted round to the front of the altar. An altar boy held up the missal, opened to the correct page; another extended a microphone on a pole.<br><br> Once, in his youth, Lomeli had enjoyed a modest fame for the richness of his baritone. But it had become thin with age, like a fine wine left too long. He clasped his hands, closed his eyes for a moment, took a breath, and intoned in a wavering plainsong, amplified around the basilica:<br><br><i> &#x201c;In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti . . .&#x201d; </i><br> And from the colossal congregation arose the murmured sung response: <br><i> &#x201c;Amen.&#x201d; </i><br> He raised his hands in benediction and chanted again, extending the three syllables into half a dozen: <br><i> &#x201c;Pa-a-x vob-i-is.&#x201d; </i><br> And they responded: <br><i> &#x201c;Et cum spiritu tuo.&#x201d; </i><br> He had begun.<br></p><p>Excerpted from&nbsp;<b>Conclave </b>by Robert Harris.

Such a character is clearly the ideal author of a book of Holmes-based conundrums and problems.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Mind&#39;s Eye</h2><p><p>With compassion and insight, Dr. Oliver Sacks again illuminates the mysteries of the brain by introducing us to some remarkable characters, including Pat, who remains a vivacious communicator despite the stroke that deprives her of speech, and Howard, a novelist who loses the ability to read. Sacks investigates those who can see perfectly well but are unable to recognize faces, even those of their own children. He describes totally blind people who navigate by touch and smell; and others who, ironically, become hyper-visual. Finally, he recounts his own battle with an eye tumor and the strange visual symptoms it caused. As he has done in classics like <i>The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat</i> and <i>Awakenings</i>, Dr. Sacks shows us that medicine is both an art and a science, and that our ability to imagine what it is to see with another person's mind is what makes us truly human.</p></p><p><p>Oliver Sacks was a neurologist, writer, and professor of medicine. Born in London in 1933, he moved to New York City in 1965, where he launched his medical career and began writing case studies of his patients. Called the &#x201c;poet laureate of medicine&#x201d; by <i>The New York Times</i>, Sacks is the author of thirteen books, including <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,</i>&nbsp;<i>Musicophilia</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Awakenings</i>, which inspired an Oscar-nominated film and a play by Harold Pinter.&nbsp;He was the recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, and was made a Commander of the British Empire in 2008 for services to medicine. He died in 2015.<br><br></p>Sight Reading<br><br> In January of 1999, I received the following letter:<br><br> Dear Dr. Sacks,<br><br> My (very unusual) problem, in one sentence, and in non-medical terms, is: I can't read. I can't read music, or anything else. In the ophthalmologist's office, I can read the individual letters on the eye chart down to the last line. But I cannot read words, and music gives me the same problem. I have struggled with this for years, have been to the best doctors, and no one has been able to help. I would be ever so happy and grateful if you could find the time to see me.<br><br> Sincerely yours, <br>Lilian Kallir<br> I phoned Mrs. Kallir-this seemed to be the thing to do, although I normally would have written back-because although she apparently had no difficulty writing a letter, she had said that she could not read at all. I spoke to her and arranged to see her at the neurology clinic where I worked.<br><br> Mrs. Kallir came to the clinic soon afterward-a cultivated, vivacious sixty-seven-year-old woman with a strong Prague accent-and related her story to me in much more detail. She was a pianist, she said; indeed, I knew her by name, as a brilliant interpreter of Chopin and Mozart (she had given her first public concert at the age of four, and Gary Graffman, the celebrated pianist, called her "one of the most naturally musical people I've ever known").<br><br> The first intimation of anything wrong, she said, had come during a concert in 1991. She was performing Mozart piano concertos, and there was a last-minute change in the program, from the Nineteenth Piano Concerto to the Twenty-first. But when she flipped open the score of the Twenty-first, she found it, to her bewilderment, completely unintelligible. Although she saw the staves, the lines, the individual notes sharp and clear, none of it seemed to hang together, to make sense. She thought the difficulty must have something to do with her eyes. But she went on to perform the concerto flawlessly from memory, and dismissed the strange incident as "one of those things."<br><br> Several months later, the problem recurred, and her ability to read musical scores began to fluctuate. If she was tired or ill, she could hardly read them at all, though when she was fresh, her sight-reading was as swift and easy as ever. But in general the problem worsened, and though she continued to teach, to record, and to give concerts around the world, she depended increasingly on her musical memory and her extensive repertoire, since it was now becoming impossible for her to learn new music by sight. "I used to be a fantastic sight reader," she said, "easily able to play a Mozart concerto by sight, and now I can't."<br><br> Occasionally at concerts she experienced lapses of memory, though Lilian (as she asked me to call her) was adept at improvising and could usually cover these. When she was at ease, with friends or students, her playing seemed as good as ever. So, through inertia, or fear, or a sort of adjustment, it was possible for her to overlook her peculiar problems in reading music, for she had no other visual problems, and her memory and ingenuity still allowed her a full musical life.<br><br> In 1994, three years or so after she had first noticed problems reading music, Lilian started to have problems with reading words. Here again, there were good days and bad, and even times when her ability to read seemed to change from moment to moment: a sentence would look strange, unintelligible at first; then suddenly it would look fine, and she would have no difficulty reading it. Her ability to write, however, was quite unaffected, and she continued to maintain a large correspondence with former students and colleagues scattered throughout the world, though she depended increasingly on her husband to read the letters she received, and even to reread her own.<br><br> Pure alexia, unaccompanied by any difficulty in writing ("alexia sine agraphia") is not that uncommon, although it usually comes on suddenly, following a stroke or other brain injury. Less often, alexia develops gradually, as a consequence of a degenerative disease such as Alzheimer's. But Lilian was the first person I had encountered whose alexia manifested first with musical notation, a musical alexia.<br><br> By 1995 Lilian was beginning to develop additional visual problems. She noticed that she tended to "miss" objects to the right, and, after some minor mishaps, she decided that she had best give up driving.<br><br> She had sometimes wondered whether her strange problem with reading might be neurological rather than ophthalmological in origin. "How can I recognize individual letters, even the tiny ones on the bottom line of the eye doctor's chart, and yet be unable to read?" she wondered. Then, in 1996, she started to make occasional embarrassing mistakes, such as failing to recognize old friends, and she found herself thinking of a case history of mine she had read years before, entitled "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat," about a man with visual agnosia. She had chuckled when she had first read it, but now she started to wonder whether her own difficulties might be eerily similar in nature.<br><br> Finally, five years or more after her original symptoms, she was referred to a university neurology department for a full workup. Given a battery of neuropsychological tests-tests of visual perception, of memory, of verbal fluency, etc.-Lilian did particularly badly in the recognition of drawings: she called a violin a banjo, a glove a statue, a razor a pen, and pliers a banana. (Asked to write a sentence, she wrote, "This is ridiculous.") She had a fluctuating lack of awareness, or "inattention," to the right, and very poor facial recognition (measured by recognition of photographs of famous public figures). She could read, but only slowly, letter by letter. She would read a "C," an "A," a "T," and then, laboriously, "cat," without recognizing the word as a whole. Yet if she was shown words too quickly to decipher in this way, she could sometimes correctly sort them into general categories, such as "living" or "nonliving," even though she had no conscious idea of their meaning.<br><br> In contrast to these severe visual problems, her speech comprehension, repetition, and verbal fluency were all normal. An MRI of her brain was also normal, but when a PET scan was performed-this can detect slight changes in the metabolism of different brain areas, even when they appear anatomically normal-Lilian was found to have diminished metabolic activity in the posterior part of the brain, the visual cortex. This was more marked on the left side. Noting the gradual spread of difficulties in visual recognition-first of music, then of words, then of faces and objects-her neurologists felt she must have a degenerative condition, at present confined to the posterior parts of the brain. This would probably continue to worsen, though very slowly.<br><br> The underlying disease was not treatable in any radical sense, but her neurologists suggested that she might benefit from certain strategies: "guessing" words, for example, even when she could not read them in the ordinary way (for it was clear that she still possessed some mechanism that allowed unconscious or preconscious recognition of words). And they suggested that she might also use a deliberate, hyperconscious inspection of objects and faces, making particular note of their distinctive features, so that these could be identified in future encounters, even if her normal "automatic" powers of recognition were impaired.<br><br> In the three years or so that had elapsed between this neurological exam and her first visit to me, Lilian told me, she had continued to perform, though not as well, and not as frequently. She found her repertoire diminishing, because she could no longer check even familiar scores by vision. "My memory was no longer fed," she remarked. Fed visually, she meant-for she felt that her auditory memory, her auditory orientation, had increased, so that she could now, to a much larger degree than before, learn and reproduce a piece by ear. She could not only play a piece in this way (sometimes after only a single hearing); she could rearrange it in her mind. Nonetheless, there was, on balance, a shrinkage of her repertoire, and she began to avoid giving public concerts. She continued to play in more informal settings and to teach master classes at the music school.<br><br> Handing me the neurological report from 1996, she commented, "The doctors all say, 'Posterior cortical atrophy of the left hemisphere, very atypical,' and then they smile apologetically-but there's nothing they can do."<br><br> When I examined Lilian, I found that she had no problem matching colors or shapes, or recognizing movement or depth. But she showed gross problems in other areas. She was unable now to recognize individual letters or numerals (even though she still had no difficulty writing complete sentences). She had, too, a more general visual agnosia, and when I presented her with pictures to identify, it was difficult for her even to recognize pictures as pictures-she would sometimes look at a column of print or a white margin, thinking it was the picture I was quizzing her about. Of one such picture, she said, "I see a V, very elegant-two little dots here, then an oval, with little white dots in between. I don't know what it's supposed to be." When I told her it was a helicopter, she laughed, embarrassed. (The V was a sling; the helicopter was unloading food supplies for refugees. The two little dots were wheels, the oval the helicopter's body.) Thus she was now seeing only individual features of an object or picture, failing to synthesize them, to see them as a whole, much less to interpret them correctly. Shown a photograph of a face, she could perceive that the person was wearing glasses, nothing else. When I asked if she could see clearly, she said, "It's not a blur, it's a mush"-a mush consisting of clear, fine, sharp but unintelligible shapes and details.<br><br> Looking at the drawings in a standard neurological test booklet, she said of a pencil, "Could be so many things. Could be a violin . . . a pen." A house, however, she immediately recognized. Regarding a whistle, she said, "I have no idea." Shown a drawing of scissors, she looked steadfastly at the wrong place, at the white paper below the drawing. Was Lilian's difficulty in recognizing drawings due simply to their "sketchiness," their two-dimensionality, their poverty of information? Or did it reflect a higher-order difficulty with the perception of representation as such? Would she do better with real objects?<br><br> When I asked Lilian how she felt about herself and her situation, she said, "I think I am dealing with it very well, most of the time . . . knowing it is not getting better, but only slowly worse. I've stopped seeing neurologists. I always hear the same thing. . . . But I am a very resilient person. I don't tell my friends. I don't want to burden them, and my little story is not very promising. A dead end. . . . I have a good sense of humor. And that's it, in a nutshell. It is depressing, when I think of it- frustrations daily. But I have many good days and years ahead."<br><br> After Lilian left, I was unable to find my medical bag-a black bag with some similarities (I now remembered) to one of the several bags she had brought. Going home in the taxi, she realized that she had taken the wrong bag when she saw a red-tipped object sticking out of it (my long, red-tipped reflex hammer). It had attracted her attention, by its color and shape, when she saw it on my desk, and now she realized her mistake. Returning, breathless and apologetic, to the clinic, she said, "I am the woman who mistook the doctor's bag for her handbag."<br><br> Lilian had done so badly on the formal tests of visual recognition that I had difficulty imagining how she managed in daily life. How did she recognize a taxi, for example? How could she recognize her own home? How could she shop, as she told me she did, or recognize foods and serve them on a table? All this and much more-an active social life, traveling, going to concerts, and teaching-she did by herself when her husband, who was also a musician, went to Europe for weeks at a time. I could get no idea of how she accomplished this from seeing her dismal performance in the artificial, impoverished atmosphere of a neurology clinic. I had to see her in her own familiar surroundings.<br><br> The following month, I visited Lilian at home, home being a pleasant apartment in upper Manhattan where she and her husband had lived for more than forty years. Claude was a charming, genial man about the same age as his wife. They had met as music students at Tanglewood nearly fifty years earlier and had pursued their musical careers in tandem, often performing on stage together. The apartment had a friendly, cultured atmosphere, with a grand piano, a great many books, photographs of their daughter and of friends and family, abstract, modernist paintings on the wall, and mementos of their trips on every available surface. It was crowded-rich in personal history and significance, I imagined, but a nightmare, a complete chaos, for someone with visual agnosia. This, at least, was my first thought as I entered, negotiating my way between tables full of knickknacks. But Lilian had no difficulty with the clutter and threaded her way confidently through the obstacles.<br><br> Since she had had such difficulty on the drawing-recognition test, I had brought a number of solid objects with me, wondering if she would do better with these. I started with some fruit and vegetables I had just bought, and here Lilian did surprisingly well. She instantly identified "a beautiful red pepper," recognizing it from across the room; a banana, too. She was momentarily uncertain whether the third object was an apple or a tomato, though she soon decided, correctly, on the former. When I showed her a small plastic model of a wolf (I keep a variety of such objects, for perceptual testing, in my medical bag), she exclaimed, "A marvelous animal! A baby elephant, perhaps?" When I asked her to look more closely, she decided it was "a kind of dog."<br><br> Lilian's relative success in naming solid objects, as opposed to drawings of them, again made me wonder whether she had a specific agnosia for representations. The recognition of representations may require a sort of learning, the grasping of a code or convention, beyond that needed for the recognition of objects. Thus, it is said, people from primitive cultures who have never been exposed to photographs may fail to recognize that they are representations of something else.&nbsp;</p><h2>Newspaper Blackout</h2><p><p> Poet and cartoonist Austin Kleon has discovered a new way to read between the lines.

He's newly married (to Graciela, who herself dragged him from retirement into a case in <i>Blood Work</i>), has a new baby daughter, and is finally strong again after a heart transplant. But once a bloodhound, always a bloodhound. One look at the video of Edward Gunn's trussed and strangled body puts McCaleb back on the investigative trail, hooked by two details: the small statue of an owl that watches over the murder scene and the Latin words "Cave Cave Dus Videt," meaning "Beware, beware, God sees," on the tape binding the victim's mouth. <p> Gunn was a small-time criminal who had been questioned repeatedly by LAPD Detective Harry Bosch in the unsolved murder of a prostitute, most recently on the night he was killed. McCaleb knows the tense, cranky Bosch (Michael Connelly's series star--see <i>The Black Echo</i>, <i>The Black Ice</i>, et al.) and decides to start by talking to him. But Bosch has time only for a brief chat. He's a prosecution witness in the high-profile trial of David Storey, a film director accused of killing a young actress during rough sex. By chance, however, McCaleb discovers an abstruse but concrete link between the scene of Gunn's murder and Harry Bosch's name: </p><blockquote>"This last guy's work is supposedly replete with owls all over the place. I can't pronounce his first name. It's spelled H-I-E-R-O-N-Y-M-U-S. He was Netherlandish, part of the northern renaissance. I guess owls were big up there."<p> McCaleb looked at the paper in front of him. The name she had just spelled seemed familiar to him.</p><p> "You forgot his last name. What's his last name?"</p><p> "Oh, sorry. It's Bosch. Like the spark plugs."</p></blockquote> Bosch fits McCaleb's profile of the killer, and McCaleb is both thunderstruck and afraid--thunderstruck that a cop he respects might have committed a horrendous murder and afraid that Bosch may just be good enough to get away with it. And when Bosch finds out (via a mysterious leak to tabloid reporter Jack McEvoy, late of Connelly's <i>The Poet</i>) that he's being investigated for murder, he's furious, knowing that Storey's defense attorney may use the information to help get his extravagantly guilty client off scot-free.<p> It's the kind of plot that used to make great Westerns: two old gunslingers circling each other warily, each of them wondering if the other's gone bad. But there's more than one black hat in them thar hills, and Connelly masterfully joins the plot lines in a climax and denouement that will leave readers gasping but satisfied. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Ghost Towns of the West</h2><p><p><b><i>Ghosts Towns of the West </i>is filled with photographs, maps, history, and detailed directions to find the best ghost towns to linger in the wake of the Old West.</b></p><p><i>Ghost Towns of the West</i> blazes a trail through the dusty crossroads and mossy cemeteries of the American West, including <b>one-time boomtowns</b> in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

Just over a decade old, the magnificent estate, called the Pastures, was already known as one of the finest houses of the New York state capital by dint of its exquisite furnishings and trimmings. The pi�ce de r�sistance was </i>The Ruins of Rome, <i>a set of hand-painted grisaille wallpapers decorating the home&#x2019;s second-floor ballroom, which Philip Schuyler had brought back from a year-long trip to England in 1762. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>The local gentry was impressed by the mansion&#x2019;s square footage and elegant appointments, but they were more taken with the general&#x2019;s and Mrs. Schuyler&#x2019;s impressive pedigrees: Philip was descended from the Schuylers and the Van Cortlandts, two of the oldest and most prestigious families in New York, while his wife, Catherine, was a Van Rensselaer, the single most prominent family in the northern half of the colony, whose tenure stretched all the way back to the Dutch days of the early 1600s. Rensselaerwyck, as their estate was known, encompassed more than half a million acres, an unimaginably vast parcel, rivaled only by that of the Livingston family, who controlled what Catherine derisively referred to as &#x201c;the bottom half&#x201d; of the state. As a married woman, Catherine wasn&#x2019;t entitled to any claim on the Van Rensselaer properties (or, for that matter, her husband&#x2019;s), but rumor had it that her sizable dowry had paid for construction of their Albany mansion, as well as the Schuylers&#x2019; country estate outside Saratoga. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Just shy of his forty-fourth birthday, General Philip Schuyler was a handsome man, tall and fit, with a military bearing and a full head of hair that, like George Washington, he wore powdered and softly curled, rarely resorting to the elegant (but rather itchy) affectation of a periwig. As a commander in Washington&#x2019;s Continental army, Schuyler had organized a brilliant campaign against the British forces at Qu�bec in 1775, only to be forced to resign his commission in June of this year, after Fort Ticonderoga fell while under his command. The defeat had been a double tragedy for Philip. Not only had the British taken the fort, they&#x2019;d also seized his aforementioned Saratoga estate. Though not as grand as the Albany property, the Schuylers&#x2019; second home was still sumptuous enough that John Burgoyne, commander of the British forces, chose it for his personal residence. But the coup de gr�ce came when the Continental army retook Saratoga in October, and a spiteful Burgoyne set fire to the house and fields during his retreat. General Schuyler had all but depleted his wife&#x2019;s inheritance building the house and bringing the land under tillage, which was expected to provide much of the family&#x2019;s income. The loss put a serious dent in the family&#x2019;s finances and cast an ominous shadow over their future. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Not that an observer would know it. Unused to idleness, General Schuyler had spent the past four months striding about the Pastures, laying out new beds in the formal gardens, regimenting the orchard harvest with military precision, supervising the construction of gazebos and guest houses and servant cottages, and generally getting in everyone&#x2019;s way, servant and family member alike. In a magnanimous gesture that indicated just how chivalrous he was&#x2014;and how bored&#x2014; Schuyler had even offered to put up the captured John Burgoyne before the British general was shipped back to England. Thus, did Schuyler&#x2019;s one-time rival and his entourage, some twenty strong, &#x201c;occupy&#x201d; the Albany mansion for a full month, and even if they didn&#x2019;t burn it down when they left, they still managed to eat a good-size hole into the family&#x2019;s provisions, comestible and otherwise. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Catherine Schuyler, one year younger than her husband, had been known as a &#x201c;handsome woman&#x201d; in her youth, but thirteen pregnancies in twenty years had taken their toll on her waistline. Practical, strong-willed, and stoic, she had buried no fewer than six of her children, including a set of triplets who hadn&#x2019;t lived long enough to be baptized. If the pregnancies had stolen her figure, the deaths had taken her smile, and watching her husband fritter away her financial assets had done little to improve her spirits. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Mrs. Schuyler&#x2019;s love for the seven children who remained to her was evident in the care she took of them, from the wet nurses and nannies she handpicked to raise them, to the tutors she hired to educate them, to the cooks she employed to keep them well fed. And somehow in the midst of the numbing cycle of births and deaths, declarations and proclamations, sieges and seasons, the Schuylers&#x2019; three eldest girls had all reached marrying age. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Angelica, the oldest, was a whip-smart, mischievous brunette, with glittering eyes, her pretty lips set in a perpetual smirk. Peggy, the youngest, was a waifish beauty, with a waist so tiny that she rarely bothered with a corset, and alabaster skin set off by a mass of lustrous dark hair that was simply too gorgeous to powder or bury under a wig (no matter what Marie Antoinette was covering her head with at Versailles). </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Eliza, the middle daughter, was as clever as Angelica and as beautiful as Peggy. She was also the most sensible, more interested in books than fashion, and, much to her mother&#x2019;s consternation, more devoted to the revolutionary cause and the mantle of abolition than to marrying one of its well-off colonels. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Her mother really didn&#x2019;t know what she was going to do with her. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Three daughters, each a prize in her own way (though Eliza would need a strong man to match her spirit). Under normal circumstances, marrying them off would be a feat of sustained diplomacy in which the first families of New York bound their blood and fortunes together like European aristocracy. But New York&#x2019;s respectable families were few in number, and word traveled quickly. It would be only a matter of time before people found out just how much the Schuylers had lost at Saratoga, at which point the girls would become damaged goods. It was imperative, then&#x2014;both to their futures and the family&#x2019;s&#x2014;that they married well. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>But it was even more important that they married fast. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>And so, Mrs. Schuyler resorted to a strategy that had served her own mother well in times of need. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>She was throwing a ball.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <b>1</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Middle Child <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Schuyler Mansion</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Albany, New York</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>November 1777 </i>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The mansion on the hill shone like a lighthouse. <br> &nbsp;<br> Twenty windows stretched across the riverfront of the Pastures, each one ablaze from dozens of oil lamps and candlesticks. Shadows flitted behind the curtains as the household prepared for the party&#x2014;servants busily rearranging the furniture to make room for dancing as well as laying out trays of preserves, candied nuts and cured meats. Inside the second-floor ballroom, hired musicians set up their instruments, ears tuned to their strings. Upstairs in their private quarters, family members stood before their looking glasses putting the final touches on their evening costumes. Hoops and panniers harnessed onto the women, jabots and lace cuffs fastened onto the men. <br> &nbsp;<br> At least Eliza hoped it was just the household getting ready. Her mother would scold them mercilessly if she and her sisters were to walk into the house after the guests were already there. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Has anyone arrived yet?&#x201d; she asked her sisters as she caught her breath beneath the weight of her load. Each of them was holding heavy bolts of blue wool and white cotton that they had gathered from the well-heeled women of Albany to make uniforms for the Continental troops. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; Peggy, the youngest, said, panting from exertion. &#x201c;It was just past four when we left the Van Broeks&#x2019; house, so it can&#x2019;t be five yet. Mama&#x2019;s invitation was for five o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And we know none of these Albany ladies likes to be the first to a party,&#x201d; added Angelica knowingly. <br> &nbsp;<br> Eliza bit her lip, doubtful. &#x201c;Even so, we should go in through the back entrance. With any luck, Mama won&#x2019;t see us come in.&#x201d; She could practically feel the weight of their mother&#x2019;s censorious gaze as the sisters labored up the hillside&#x2019;s sixty-seven stone steps hauling four dozen reams of fabric. At the top of the hill, the threesome quickly skirted around the south side of the mansion and passed through one of the covered porticos that connected the main body of the mansion with its flanking wings. The wing on this side contained her father&#x2019;s military office, and Eliza was surprised to see that it was as lit up as the rest of the house. Mama would be furious to find Papa still working so near to the ball&#x2019;s starting time. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Were Mama and Papa quarreling this morning?&#x201d; she asked her sisters. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d hate to think that Papa won&#x2019;t be attending the party because of some disagreement.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hope not; things can be so dreary otherwise. What Mama allows the musicians to play are practically dirges. It&#x2019;s positively funereal,&#x201d; said Angelica with a sniff. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did Dot mention anything?&#x201d; Eliza asked Peggy, who was close to their lady&#x2019;s maid. Some might find it strange that a servant was expected to know more than they did about the state of their parents&#x2019; union. But the Schuylers, as befit their station, were a formal family and a busy one, and although there were seven children in the house, it was normal for them not to see one another until they gathered for dinner. The servants, by contrast, were in constant congress, and maids and valets and field workers kept one another apprised of the goings-on in the house. Thus Dot was much more likely than the sisters to have the temperature of the current state of their parents&#x2019; marriage. Though solid and, in its own way, caring, the Schuyler union was conducted with as much diplomacy as Ambassador Franklin was even now using in Paris to persuade Louis XVI to bring the French into the revolution on the American side. <br> &nbsp;<br> Peggy frowned. &#x201c;Dot did mention that Rodger&#x201d;&#x2014;their father&#x2019;s valet&#x2014;&#x201c;said that the general is looking forward to the party as much as the missus is.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But Mama will be quite cross with him for hiding in his office instead of helping her prepare,&#x201d; said Angelica. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nonsense,&#x201d; said Eliza. &#x201c;Mama is probably happy to have him out of the way.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Peggy continued, struggling to keep her head above the bulky cloth she carried. &#x201c;At any rate, Rodger said that Papa was expecting a visit from an aide-de-camp to General Washington.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What!&#x201d; the older sisters chorused. Eliza stopped so suddenly that Angelica crashed into her. &#x201c;Is Papa being recommissioned?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Since being relieved of duty after the loss of Fort Ticonderoga, General Schuyler had written innumerous letters asking for another command. The family felt his frustration keenly, and Heaven knows they could use the salary, but even Eliza, as patriotic as she was, was happy to have her father off the field of battle. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dot said Rodger didn&#x2019;t say,&#x201d; Peggy said, which was tantamount to saying that Rodger didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;General Schuyler&#x2019;s valet was an uncontrollable gossip, a trait the general himself was strangely ignorant of, and the rest of the family tolerated because it was how they got their news. &#x201c;But he did mention . . .&#x201d; Peggy let her voice trail off. A little smile played over her face. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; Eliza demanded. She could tell from her sister&#x2019;s expression that Peggy was savoring a juicy bit of gossip. &#x201c;Tell us!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The aide coming to the party is Colonel Hamilton,&#x201d; Peggy half squealed. <br> &nbsp;<br> Angelica raised an eyebrow and Eliza tried not to blush. <br> &nbsp;<br> Like every other girl in every other prominent American family, Eliza had heard stories of Colonel Alexander Hamilton, General Washington&#x2019;s youngest but most trusted aide-de-camp, who was, if rumors were to be trusted, heart-stoppingly handsome and dashing to boot. Colonel Hamilton had been recruited by the commander of the American forces when he was still a teenager, just a few years after arriving in the North American colonies from the sugar-rich West Indies. Some said he was the son of a Scottish lord and could have claimed a baronetcy as well as a vast fortune if he&#x2019;d chosen the loyalist side, while others said he was in fact a bastard, the illegitimate child of the disgraced son of some British aristocrat or other (there were so many!) with neither a name nor a penny of his own. <br> &nbsp;<br> What <i>was </i>known, however, was that twenty-year-old Colonel Alexander Hamilton was brilliant, having made a name as an essayist while still a student at King&#x2019;s College in New York City. He was also known as having a bit of a reputation with the ladies. Eliza&#x2019;s old friend Kitty Livingston, who had met the young colonel on several occasions, had written Eliza about him after each meeting. She had been necessarily discreet in her letters (Susannah Livingston, Kitty&#x2019;s mother, was as much of a gossip as Catherine Schuyler), but it was clear she and the young soldier had carried on quite a flirtation. Eliza had been amused by Kitty&#x2019;s letters and curious about this young man who had captured the interest of Continental society. <br> &nbsp;<br> Eliza peered through the second-floor windows of her father&#x2019;s office, hoping for a glimpse of the famous young colonel, but could discern no figures within the room, only the occasional flickering shadow. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Perhaps Church will introduce us; I&#x2019;m certain they are acquainted,&#x201d; said Angelica, meaning her rich suitor who was practically tripping over himself to ask for her hand. The oldest Schuyler sister was close to giving it, too, as John Barker Church was in the process of building one of the greatest fortunes in the new country, enough to rival or even eclipse their own father&#x2019;s (or at least before the British had burned a large part of it up at Saratoga). But Angelica was enjoying being the belle of the ball too much to relinquish it just yet. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It will be interesting to finally meet this Hamilton fellow,&#x201d; said Angelica. &#x201c;Livens up the party for once.&#x201d; Eliza shrugged, attempting to appear disinterested, but her sisters knew her better than that. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe if you wore something a little more fashionable tonight, you&#x2019;d catch his eye,&#x201d; said Peggy cheekily. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And why would I want to do that?&#x201d; Eliza retorted. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As Mama says, honey catches more flies than vinegar,&#x201d; said Peggy, echoing their mother&#x2019;s perennial advice about reeling in the right suitor&#x2014;and quickly. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Honestly, Peg,&#x201d; Eliza said, rolling her eyes. &#x201c;I have no interest in Colonel Hamilton other than to satisfy my curiosity.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you say so,&#x201d; said Peggy, sounding ...</p><h2>Give Me Your Hand</h2><p><b>Shortlisted for the CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award</b> <b></b> <b>A life-changing secret destroys an unlikely friendship in this "magnetic" (Meg Wolitzer) psychological thriller from the Edgar Award-winning author of <i>Dare Me</i>.</b><br>You told each other everything.

Baseball cards were selling for next to nothing. What had happened? In <i>Mint Condition</i>, the first comprehensive history of this American icon, Jamieson finds the answers and much more. In the years after the Civil War, tobacco companies started slipping baseball cards into cigarette packs as collector&#x2019;s items, launching a massive advertising war. Before long, the cards were wagging the cigarettes. In the 1930s, baseball cards helped gum and candy makers survive the Great Depression, and kept children in touch with the game. After World War II, Topps Chewing Gum Inc. built itself into an American icon, hooking a generation of baby boomers on bubble gum and baseball cards. In the 1960s, royalties from cards helped to transform the players&#x2019; union into one of the country&#x2019;s most powerful, dramatically altering the business of the game. And in the '80s and '90s, cards went through a spectacular bubble, becoming a billion-dollar-a-year industry before all but disappearing. Brimming with colorful characters, this is a rollicking, century-spanning, and extremely entertaining history.</p><p>Dave Jamieson has written for <i>Slate, The New Republic,</i> and <i>Washington City Paper,</i> among others, and in 2008 he won the prestigious Livingston Award for Young Journalists.

That is, do you truly have confidence that the Lord has your best interests at heart? That He has a purpose for your life and truly cares about you?<br> <br>We all struggle with these questions at one point or another throughout our lifetimes because they strike at the heart of what it means to be alive and enjoy a worthwhile existence full of significance, contentment, and meaning.<br> <br>Through the years, I&#x2019;ve found a great deal of comfort and assurance from the stories of men of faith such as Charles Spurgeon, D. L. Moody, Oswald Chambers, Hudson Taylor, and Leonard Ravenhill. Time and again, the Father showed each of these men that He is indeed good, that He has a plan for each of us, and that He cares deeply for every one of us as His children. Our lives definitely have a discoverable purpose and can make a difference in the world.<br> <br>I believe God has shown me these truths as well, and that is why I am following in their footsteps and sharing my story with you. Because the Father has shown Himself to be so loving, so strong, so faithful, and so wise, I cannot be quiet about it&#x2014;just like the disciples said in Acts 4:20, &#x201c;We cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.&#x201d; And my prayer is that the following pages will encourage you&#x2014;not because of who I am, but because of who Jesus is and what He can do in and through your life.<br> <br>PURPOSED FROM THE START<br> <br>Of course, you may be thinking, You don&#x2019;t know where I&#x2019;ve come from. I&#x2019;m not sure God could do anything through someone who came from such a rough start as I did.<br> <br>Oh yes, He can. In fact, He even chose the place of your birth for a purpose. Acts 17:26&#x2013;27 says, &#x201c;He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation that they would seek God.&#x201d;<br> <br>In other words, the Father chose when, where, and to whom you and I would be born for His eternal reasons. The location and circumstances in which we began our lives are part of His special plan for us&#x2014;not to limit where we would end up but as the unique backdrop for the awesome things He can do through a life devoted to Him.<br> <br>I certainly did not come into the world under the most optimal circumstances. I was born to Charley and Rebecca Stanley on September 25, 1932, in the small farming town of Dry Fork, Virginia, in the same room where my mother had been born. That was just three years after the devastating stock market crash of October 1929 that initiated the Great Depression, the longest and most profound economic downturn in our nation&#x2019;s history. We were grateful that my father had stable employment at the local textile mill.<br> <br>Unfortunately, just three months after I was born, in January of 1933, my father became deathly ill of a kidney condition called Bright&#x2019;s disease, an illness that would claim his life an agonizing six months later when I was only nine months old. The reality of our situation shook my young mother to the core in a manner that would affect her for the rest of her life. The Sunday before my father passed away, Mother asked him, &#x201c;What will I do if you die?&#x201d; She realized we would be on our own during a time when a fourth of the nation&#x2019;s labor force was unemployed and in desperate need, and nearly half of the country&#x2019;s banks had failed.1 How would she provide for us and take care of me, a small infant who couldn&#x2019;t yet fend for himself?<br> <br>My father had no choice but to reply, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll just have to do the best you can.&#x201d; I cannot imagine how it must have broken his heart to say those words to her. But in 1933, during the terrible depths of the Great Depression, they had already been living hand to mouth like so many other Americans. There was no backup plan, no safety net, no insurance, and no hidden store of funds. There weren&#x2019;t any options he could offer her.<br> <br>So when my father went to be with Jesus, my mother had no choice but to immediately find a job and go to work.<br> <br>When I think about her courage during that time, it moves me deeply. Caring for a small baby is difficult enough for any first-time parent. And losing the love of your life can devastate even the strongest person. Yet at the young age of twenty-four, my mother, Becca, did both&#x2014;during an economic crisis that almost crippled the nation and with little help from other family members.<br> <br>In fact, she didn&#x2019;t even have her mother and father to help her. Her mother, Flora Jane Hardy, had passed away in 1926 when Becca was only seventeen. The school bus had just pulled up and Mother looked out the window and saw her mother drawing water from the well. All of a sudden, Flora let the rope go, grabbed her head, and fell backward&#x2014;a fatal stroke ending her life instantaneously. My mother got off the bus and never went to school again because she had to take care of her brothers and sisters. Likewise, her father, George Lee Hardy, had gone to be with Jesus in the spring of 1932, just four months before I was born. So she did not even have them to rely upon.<br> <br>How did Becca survive it all? With prayer and faith in God. My mother always believed that we could trust the Lord for all of our needs.<br> <br>Did God make a mistake bringing me into the world when it was in such chaos and my father would soon pass away? Of course not. First, through those circumstances, God showed me that we cannot rely on money for our security&#x2014;we must depend on Him and Him alone. Second, the Lord taught me to look to Him as my heavenly Father and to rely on Him for guidance and provision.<br> <br>And third, God gave me such a godly example through my mother, who had a tremendous impact on my life. Even before I was born, she dedicated me to the Father for His purposes. She went down behind the house, sat on an old tree stump, and asked God to use me for His glory. That was her heart&#x2014;fully set on serving Him.<br> <br>And the way she responded to the adversity she faced&#x2014;well, watching her deal with all the pressure with such grace affected me profoundly. What were the things she did that influenced my walk with the Lord in such a positive way? They&#x2019;re not as complicated as you might think.<br> <br>FIRST, MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME to love God&#x2019;s word. She didn&#x2019;t do this by creating a reading and memorization plan. Rather, she read the Bible to me and explained how important it is to obey the principles that the Father commanded us to live by.<br> <br>Mother had no formal biblical training and probably didn&#x2019;t even know what the word theology meant, but she did the best she could. She demonstrated how to love and apply Scripture by the way she walked with the Lord daily. I remember how we would turn to the index in her well-worn, thick black Bible&#x2014;which was the only book she owned&#x2014;and looked up subjects together. Those are times children just don&#x2019;t forget.<br> <br>When I was a little older, Mother gave me my first study Bible. She wanted me to have exactly what I wanted, so she gave me money and I went to the store to pick it out. I asked the gentleman there what would be a good Bible for me, since I felt called into the ministry. He said if I was going to preach, there was only one Bible I could use&#x2014;a Thompson Chain-Reference. Of course, I knew he had to be right, because that was the exact same Bible my grandfather, George Washington Stanley, had preached from throughout his life. Interestingly, the Thompson Chain-Reference Bible was not on display in that store. Like a rare treasure, it was wrapped in brown paper and kept in a secret place under the counter. It cost fifteen dollars&#x2014;almost two weeks&#x2019; wages for my mother&#x2014;but to me it was worth a million.<br> <br>SECOND, MOTHER TAUGHT ME TO pray. She didn&#x2019;t do so by saying, &#x201c;Go listen to the pastor.&#x201d; Instead, she showed me how to get on my knees before the Father by praying with me beside my bed every night. Why did we have to be on our knees? Because this was the way we showed the Lord our reverence for Him, that we recognized our need to humble ourselves before Him. From early on, Mother showed me the importance of respecting His authority and obeying Him. Sometimes we opened the Bible during our prayer times to receive His direction, which showed me that listening to God is crucial to our walk as believers.<br> <br>At the time, I didn&#x2019;t realize how much closer this brought us. I would open up to her concerning all the troubles that I wanted her to pray about. Then she would call my name to the Lord regarding those things, building a wonderful hedge of protection around me. I can still remember how she would pray, &#x201c;Father, please bless Charles and take care of him.&#x201d; Sometimes she would even weep as she prayed, which was difficult for me to hear. I never had a doubt that my mother loved me. Her sweet prayers are etched on my mind, even so many years after she&#x2019;s gone home to heaven. They&#x2019;ve stayed with me and have encouraged me through some very difficult times.<br> <br>THIRD, MOTHER CREATED WITHIN ME a desire to know God and to depend upon him for every aspect of life. For years, she worked at the Dan River Mill, which was about sixteen miles from where we lived. I can still recall her showing me her paycheck&#x2014;she brought home just $9.10 a week and that had to cover all of our needs: food, clothing, rent, and everything else. Of course, the first thing Mother did was to tithe the little money she brought home&#x2014;no matter what. There were many times that I would look at all our expenses and think, That just isn&#x2019;t going to be enough. But she would say, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to trust God, and He will provide. He has always been good to us, and He will be faithful no matter what.&#x201d; Repeatedly, I watched her faith become reality&#x2014;seeing the Lord supply every need we had.<br> <br>So when I got my first job and began earning $4 a week, I never questioned whether or not to tithe. Mother had vividly demonstrated that God assumes full responsibility for our needs when we obey Him.<br> <br>FOURTH, MOTHER TAUGHT ME HOW important it is to obey the Lord. And her reason was so simple but so profound: We must obey God because He is GOD. She didn&#x2019;t have to give me some big theological explanation. She simply had such a profound respect for the Father that it impacted me deeply. Likewise, she modeled the consequences of disobedience by how she corrected me. It was always a proportional response&#x2014;the degree to which she disciplined me was always contingent upon how seriously I had defied her.<br> <br>Mother had two basic strategies for setting me straight. The first was that she would send me out to get a switch. She never struck me with her hand because she was wise enough to know it might have felt like rejection to my young heart. So she always used a switch to chasten me. But every once in a while, she sensed that I didn&#x2019;t need a switch; rather, my actions required something much more profoundly life altering: a motherly lecture. I would think to myself, Oh God, help me. By the time she finished, I would be in tears and in full repentance.<br> <br>Regardless of which strategy she chose, I always knew my mother disciplined me because she loved me and wanted the best for me. Of course, the same is true for God. As Hebrews 12:9&#x2013;10 reminds us, &#x201c;We had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live? For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.&#x201d;<br> <br>There are so many ways my mother influenced me that I could go on and on. She taught me to treat others as I would like to be treated and to have a servant&#x2019;s spirit. She exhibited forgiveness, even in circumstances that were terribly unfair. She showed me that when we know the right thing to do, we must complete the task faithfully, be persistent, and never quit. And she always encouraged me to look my best, do my best, and be my best. These weren&#x2019;t lessons she merely told me about&#x2014;these were principles that she demonstrated with her own life.<br> <br>ON YOUR OWN?<br> <br>Of course, you may be thinking, I didn&#x2019;t have a godly mother like that. My home life was unstable. I was alone.<br> <br>Yes, I had a faithful, godly mother, but also one with the burden of supporting us. Sadly, that meant that I was often alone, even as a very small boy, because she had to work in order for us to survive. In fact, she was usually gone by the time I woke up in the morning and couldn&#x2019;t come home until long after my school day was done. Although when she could, my mother arranged for different people to take care of me while she was away, it seemed as if I was by myself more often than not.<br> <br>In fact, one of my earliest memories is of being only two or three years old, sitting on the bed with a terrible earache. I don&#x2019;t know why that experience made such a profound impression on me, but it obviously affected me deeply because I remember it clearly. I was so miserable and felt so utterly alone because there was no one to take care of me, no one to alleviate the pain, and no one to comfort me. Mother was at work, so I sat alone in our little house with the wooden walls, crying with only a dim kerosene lamp to light the darkness. I remember wondering if my mother had left me forever because her absence that day was so overwhelming and seemed so permanent.<br> <br>I imagine that part of it was the not knowing when or if I would ever see her again. That&#x2019;s how loneliness works, of course: you begin to think no one will ever understand, accept, or care for you again. And in those early years, all we had was each other. If I lost her, I would be losing the most important person in my life. One time, my mother went somewhere on an errand and was gone all day, but she didn&#x2019;t tell me where she was going or when she would be back. I didn&#x2019;t know how to reach her or how long I would be by myself&#x2014;alone in that quiet, sparse little house. I just kept thinking, What if she never comes home to me? Who will love me? Who will help me? Why doesn&#x2019;t she stay with me? It affected me so deeply that I cried until she returned. My fears had been unfounded, of course, but that sense of loss and isolation continued to assault my young heart. Another early memory is of coming home to an empty house after school because Mother worked until about five o&#x2019;clock. I was in first grade, and like a photograph in my mind, I can still see the long black key that we hid under a brick outside. Only Mother and I knew where it was. But each afternoon as I walked up to the door, I would wonder if the key would be there. What if it was missing? What would I do? After all, it was an extremely important key to my six-year-old mind&#x2014;the key to where my mother and I lived together, where our belongings were, and where my needs were met. It represented my one place of safety, where I felt my mother&#x2019;s love and care for me. What would become of me if I couldn&#x2019;t get into my home? I always felt relieved when I moved the rock and saw the key was there.<br> <br>But that relief was only momentary. I would put that big, imposing key in the lock, hear the bolt turn over with a clang, and open the door, thinking all the while, There&#x2019;s no one here. I&#x2019;m going to be by myself. I would dread going inside, not knowing what I would encounter there and loathing the loneliness.<br> <br>I would try to make the best of...</p><h2>Hiking Death Valley: A Guide to its Natural Wonders and Mining Past</h2><p>With elevations ranging from 282 feet below sea level to 11,049 feet, a world-famous climate, and some of the most spectacular scenery in the North American desert, Death Valley National Park is a year-round hiker's paradise.

Bregg finds a society that he hardly recognizes, in which danger has been eradicated.

Enormously talented and ambitious artists, they met as contemporaries in the building yards of St. Peter's in Rome, became the greatest architects of their era by designing some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, and ended their lives as bitter enemies. Engrossing and impeccably researched, full of dramatic tension and breathtaking insight, <i>The Genius in the Design</i> is the remarkable tale of how two extraordinary visionaries schemed and maneuvered to get the better of each other and, in the process, created the spectacular Roman cityscape of today.</p></p><p><p>Jake Morrissey has studied and written about architecture for twenty years. His work has appeared in the <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, and dozens of other publications and books. He is the author of the novel <em>A Weekend at Blenheim</em> and lives near New York City.</p>Sometimes plodding but often entertaining, this dual biography of two Italian Baroque artists popularizes a tale familiar to art historians. Raised in a wealthy family with connections to politicians and cultural players, Bernini (1598&#x2013;1680) was 12 when he was commissioned to do his first major piece&#x2014;and he soon learned how to win the hearts and pocketbooks of rich patrons on his own. Borromini (1599&#x2013;1667) lacked such connections, but climbed the guild's ladder, eventually becoming chief assistant to Carlo Maderno, the chief architect of St. Peter's. When Maderno died in 1629, Borromini was shocked that Bernini was named chief. Morrissey (<i>A Weekend at Blenheim</i>) finely renders the intense rivalry between these two artists, giving a reasonable if fact-heavy look at 17th-century Roman life in the process. Borromini elected to work for Bernini, but tensions soon led to a break; Bernini went on to complete the <i>Scala Regia</i> and the <i>Cathedra Petri</i>; Borromini found fewer and fewer commissions and eventually killed himself. The book doesn't do justice to the varying levels of ambition, engagement and achievement Morrissey finds in these figures, but it does an adequate job sketching their contours. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Major Holly Barker thought she was getting out of a mess when she left the army. She'd been sexually harassed by her superior, but the exigencies of the military legal system wound up wrecking <i>her</i> career. Orchid Beach seemed like the perfect place to start over. Though Chief Marley, an old family friend, was worried about some local increases in the drug trade, the Florida barrier island was not a crime mecca. As the new deputy police chief, Holly would be stepping on the toes of a few Orchid Beach P.D. regulars who were being overlooked for the job, but she would prove her worth in short order. After installing her trailer in Riverview, though, the bad news started to flood the Beach. The chief was found along the side of highway A1A with a bullet through the head, and his closest friend just had his skull blown apart with the chief's shotgun. Now, Holly is the acting chief in a town she hardly knows and with a police force that's full of animosity towards its newly minted leader. Just about the only consolation is that Holly has inherited Daisy, a Doberman who's about the best and most faithful friend a troubled gal could ask for; Daisy's a fierce defender of her master and she knows how to retrieve a beer on command.<p> Holly is a new character for Stuart Woods, and the author wastes no time getting readers into the thick of the mystery. This means that character takes a bit of a back seat to plotting in <i>Orchid Beach</i>, but with a mystery this fast-paced, the tradeoff is worthwhile. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Stuart Woods delivers a riveting thriller that introduces an exciting addition to the pantheon of fictional sleuths.</p><p>Forced into early retirement at thirty-seven, smart, attractive, and fiercely independent Major Holly Barker trades in her bars as a military cop for the badge of deputy chief of police in Orchid Beach, Florida.

Sometimes it&#x2019;s love, sometimes it&#x2019;s convenience, sometimes it&#x2019;s just so the other person can&#x2019;t testify against them. Whatever the reason, staying married is not easy to do. In fact, for many people it&#x2019;s a source of grief. If that&#x2019;s how it is for you, try using the Seven Stages of Grief as guideposts on your journey towards marital bliss. Or at least as a way of controlling your homicidal urges.<br>&nbsp;<br>1. Denial<br>This initial stage usually manifests itself shortly after the wedding. There are many symptoms, but the common thread is that you&#x2019;re continuing the same behaviour you enjoyed prior to getting married&#x2014;hanging out with your single friends, coming home late without phoning, trying to meet women on the Internet, etc. These habits are inappropriate now that you are a husband. You must get through the denial stage quickly, or it could outlast the marriage.<br>&nbsp;<br>2. Guilt<br>After the first year of marriage, you will start hearing a small voice in the back of your head, making you feel guilty about your unacceptable levels of grooming, your inappropriate responses in social situations and your insensitivity towards your spouse. This small voice will be very familiar to you because it is your wife&#x2019;s. When it becomes your own voice doing the behaviour modification, you will have successfully passed through the guilt stage and will be ready to meet the next challenge.<br>&nbsp;<br>3. Anger<br>The day will come (usually right after an argument you lost) when you start to feel a sense of resentment towards the institution of marriage. You&#x2019;ll be focused on the loss of personal freedom and the need for permission in every aspect of your existence. This resentment will turn to anger as you contemplate how your life could have been if you had never married. Instead of a home, you could own a Corvette. Instead of having a stressful corporate position, you could be a surfer. Instead of being a respected and responsible member of your community, you could be a boy toy in Monte Carlo. At the anger stage, it is helpful to talk with close friends (especially female ones) who can update you on your realistic options. It may be hard for you to hear, but if you are mature enough to accept their advice, you will be on track to returning to a happy marriage. Yes, I suppose the sight of you as a Corvette-driving surfer boy toy in Monte Carlo would be an entertaining one for the locals, but you&#x2019;re much better off in an environment where someone has already vowed to take responsibility for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>4. Depression<br>After the anger dissipates, the next stage is a deep sadness from the realization that married life isn&#x2019;t as great as you expected and it&#x2019;s only going to get worse. This is the period when sleeping with your wife becomes exactly that. Conversations between you become short and fact-based. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s garbage night.&#x201d; &#x201c;Yeah, yeah.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a period that&#x2019;s often marked by significant weight gain and an increase in the number of empty bottles in the recycling bin. Some couples have a brief trial separation, which may be as simple as one of them getting a job. But the key to getting through this stage is to realize that being depressed about the relationship you&#x2019;re in is actually more unpleasant than the relationship itself. When you see depression for what it is&#x2014;nature&#x2019;s way of taking a bad situation and making it worse&#x2014;you&#x2019;re ready to move on to the next stage.<br>&nbsp;<br>5. The Upward Turn<br>The good side of depression is that it sinks you below reality, which means that as you come back to reality you&#x2019;re actually moving up. Now you have some upward momentum, and if you can find a way to sustain it, you&#x2019;re on your way to your version of a happy marriage. This is a very important stage, and you must be prepared to do everything in your power to maintain that upward movement. I recommend asking a police artist to do what they call &#x201c;age progressions&#x201d; on your photographs of old girlfriends. Seeing what they look like now will remove your sense of lost opportunities. Next, you need to spend time with some really miserable husbands and encourage them to tell you all of their horror stories. It&#x2019;ll be worth picking up the bar bill, because by the time they&#x2019;re finished, you&#x2019;ll feel like the luckiest man alive.<br>&nbsp;<br>6. Reconstruction<br>This is your best opportunity to rebuild your marriage. You now have a much better sense of the structural weaknesses and the materials you&#x2019;re working with. You may not ever know what exactly your wife wants, but you have at least ten years of evidence of what she doesn&#x2019;t want. So start by not giving her any of that stuff. Start dressing better, lose a few pounds, put the seat down. She&#x2019;ll notice you stepping up your game and she&#x2019;ll step up hers. Even if you&#x2019;re not sure you still love your wife, pretend that you do, and pretty soon you will.<br>&nbsp;<br>7. Acceptance<br>This is the final stage of marriage. This is the goal, the point where you acknowledge that, all in all, you got a very fair return on your investment and really have nothing major to complain about. As in almost all of the other stages, the best way to accomplish this goal is to put aside your biases and seek an accurate evaluation of yourself. I know it&#x2019;s impossible to stop you from being judgmental; instead, I&#x2019;m asking to apply that attitude to you. For starters, go to the wax museum and get your picture taken standing beside the statue of Brad Pitt. Then show the picture around and see if anybody has difficulty picking out which one is you. Next, go on Google and find a list of the five hundred richest men in the world. Is your name on it? Stop ten strangers on the street and ask them if they know who you are. Okay, so now you have some sense of where you fit in the rich, famous or good-looking category. Next, draw a vertical line down the middle of a piece of paper. On one side, write the nice things your wife has done for you over the years. On the other side, write down the nice things you&#x2019;ve done for her. If you run out of room on her side, there&#x2019;s probably available space on yours. These exercises will not only bring you to the level of acceptance needed to keep your marriage together, they will introduce the shared ingredient that&#x2019;s going to make the remaining years of marriage the best yet&#x2014;gratitude.</p><h2>Sacred Symbols of the Dogon: The Key to Advanced Science in the Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs</h2><p>Dogon cosmology provides a new Rosetta stone for reinterpreting Egyptian hieroglyphs <br><br>� Provides a new understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs as scientific symbols based on Dogon cosmological drawings <br><br>� Use parallels between Dogon and Egyptian word meanings to identify relationships between Dogon myths and modern science <br><br>In <i>The Science of the Dogon</i>, Laird Scranton demonstrated that the cosmological structure described in the myths and drawings of the Dogon runs parallel to modern science--atomic theory, quantum theory, and string theory--their drawings often taking the same form as accurate scientific diagrams that relate to the formation of matter.

The Bible was written by ancient Hebrews whose culture and language was very different from our own and must be read and interpreted through their eyes. When we define the names of God using our culture and language we lose the Hebraic meanings behind the original Hebrew names of God. Consequently the true nature and character of God is hidden behind the veil of time and culture. By understanding the various names of God through the vocabulary and language of the ancient Hebrews, the nature and character of God is revealed to us in a new light. The prophet Zechariah described the character of God with the words &#34;sh&#39;mo ehhad&#34; translated as His Name is One (Zechariah 14:9). This phrase beautifully describes the character of God from a Hebraic perspective that is lost to us through translation and unfamiliarity with ancient Hebrew culture.</p><p>An indepth look at the names of God as understood by the ancient Hebrews whose writings in the Bible are filled with vivid images of God lost through translation and culture.I wrote this book as a result of the many requests for the meanings of the various names of God in the Bible. This book details how the ancient Hebrews understood God from their cultural perspective. What is a name? In our modern western culture a name is simply an identifier but to the Hebrews, a name contained the whole of the individual. Probably the most common name of God in Hebrew is Elohiym and from an ancient Hebraic perspective this word means &#34;The mighty one who yokes himself to his people&#34;.</p><h2>Whispers of His Power</h2><p>Simple and poetic, Whispers of His Power contains a selection of 366 daily devotional readings culled from Amy Carmichael&#39;s previously unpublished letters and writings of encouragement.

Introduction: The Most Human Human <br><br>I wake up five thousand miles from home in a hotel room with no shower: for the first time in fifteen years, I take a bath. I eat, as is traditional, some slightly ominous-looking tomatoes, some baked beans, and four halves of white toast that come on a tiny metal rack, shelved vertically, like books. Then I step out into the salty air and walk the coastline of the country that invented my language, despite my not being able to understand a good portion of the signs I pass on my way&#x2014;let agreed, one says, prominently, in large print, and it means nothing to me. <br><br>I pause, and stare dumbly at the sea for a moment, parsing and reparsing the sign in my head. Normally these kinds of linguistic curiosities and cultural gaps interest and intrigue me; today, though, they are mostly a cause for concern. In the next two hours I will sit down at a computer and have a series of five- minute instant- message chats with several strangers. At the other end of these chats will be a psychologist, a linguist, a computer scientist, and the host of a popu�lar British technology show. Together they form a judging panel, and my goal in these conversations is one of the strangest things I&#x2019;ve ever been asked to do. <br><br>I must convince them that I&#x2019;m human. Fortunately, I <i>am</i> human; unfortunately, it&#x2019;s not clear how much that will help. <br><i>The Turing Test </i><br><br>Each year, the artificial intelligence (AI) community convenes for the field&#x2019;s most anticipated and controversial annual event&#x2014;a competi�tion called the Turing test. The test is named for British mathemati�cian Alan Turing, one of the founders of computer science, who in 1950 attempted to answer one of the field&#x2019;s earliest questions: <i>Can machines think?</i> That is, would it ever be possible to construct a com�puter so sophisticated that it could actually be said to be thinking, to be intelligent, to have a mind? And if indeed there were, someday, such a machine: How would we know? <br>Instead of debating this question on purely theoretical grounds, Turing proposed an experiment. A panel of judges poses questions by computer terminal to a pair of unseen correspondents, one a human &#x201c;confederate,&#x201d; the other a computer program, and attempts to discern which is which. There are no restrictions on what can be said: the dialogue can range from small talk to the facts of the world (e.g., how many legs ants have, what country Paris is in) to celebrity gossip and heavy-duty philosophy&#x2014;the whole gamut of human conversation. Turing predicted that by the year 2000, computers would be able to fool 30 percent of human judges after five minutes of conversation, and that as a result &#x201c;one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.&#x201d; <br><br>Turing&#x2019;s prediction has not come to pass; at the 2008 contest, how�ever, held in Reading, England, the top program came up shy of that mark by just a single vote. The 2009 test in Brighton could be the decisive one. <br>And I am participating in it, as one of four human confederates going&nbsp; head-to-head&nbsp; (head-to-motherboard?) against the top AI pro�grams. In each of several rounds, I, along with the other confederates, will be paired off with an AI program and a&nbsp; judge&#x2014;and will have the task of convincing the latter that I am, in fact, human. <br><br>The judge will talk to one of us for five minutes, then the other, and then has ten minutes to reflect and make his choice about which one of us he believes is the human. Judges will also note, on a slid�ing scale, their confidence in this&nbsp; judgment&#x2014;this is used in part as a tie-breaking measure. The program that receives the highest share of votes and confidence from the judges each year (regardless of whether it &#x201c;passes the Turing test&#x201d; by fooling 30 percent of them) is awarded the &#x201c;Most Human Computer&#x201d; title. It is this title that the research teams are all gunning for, the one that the money awards, the one with which the organizers and spectators are principally concerned. But there is also, intriguingly, another title, one given to the <i>confeder�ate</i> who elicited the greatest number of votes and greatest confi dence from the judges: the &#x201c;Most Human Human&#x201d; award. <br><br>One of the first winners, in 1994, was <i>Wired</i> columnist Charles Platt. How&#x2019;d he do it? By &#x201c;being moody, irritable, and obnoxious,&#x201d; he says&#x2014;which strikes me as not only hilarious and bleak but also, in some deeper sense, a call to arms: How, in fact, do we be the most human humans we can&nbsp; be&#x2014; not only under the constraints of the test, but in life? <br><i>Joining the Confederacy </i><br><br>The sponsor and organizer of the Turing test (this particular incarna�tion of which is known as the Loebner Prize) is a colorful and some�what curious figure: plastic&nbsp; roll-up portable disco dance fl oor baron Hugh Loebner. When asked his motives for backing and orchestrat�ing this annual Turing test, Loebner cites <i>laziness,</i> of all things: his utopian future, apparently, is one in which unemployment rates are nearly 100 percent and virtually all of human endeavor and industry is outsourced to intelligent machines. I must say, this vision of the future makes me feel little but despair, and I have my own, quite different ideas about what an AI-populated world would look like and reasons for participating in the test. But in any event, the central question of how computers are reshaping our sense of self, and what the ramifications of that process will be, is clearly the crucial one. <br><br>Not entirely sure how to go about becoming a confederate, I started at the top: by trying to reach Hugh Loebner himself. I quickly found his website, where, amid a fairly inscrutable amalgam of mate�rial about&nbsp; crowd-control stanchions,1&nbsp;sex- work activism,2 and a scan�dal involving the composition of Olympic medals,3&nbsp;I was able to fi nd information on his eponymous prize, along with his email address. He replied by giving me the name of Philip Jackson, a professor at the University of Surrey, who is the one in charge of the logistics for this year&#x2019;s Loebner Prize contest in Brighton, where it will be held under the auspices of the 2009 Interspeech conference on speech and com�munication science. <br><br>I was able to get in touch via Skype with Professor Jackson, a young, smart guy with the distinct brand of harried enthusiasm that characterizes an overworked but&nbsp; fresh-faced academic. That and his charming Briticisms, like pronouncing &#x201c;skeletal&#x201d; so it&#x2019;d rhyme with &#x201c;a beetle&#x201d;: I liked him immediately. He asked me about myself, and I explained that I&#x2019;m a nonfi ction writer of science and philosophy, specifically of the ways in which science and philosophy intersect with daily life, and that I&#x2019;m fasci�nated by the idea of the Turing test and of the &#x201c;Most Human Human.&#x201d; For one, there&#x2019;s a romantic notion as a confederate of <i>defending the human race,</i> � la Garry Kasparov vs. Deep Blue&#x2014;and soon, Ken.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Jennings of <i>Jeopardy!</i> fame vs. the latest IBM system, Watson. (The mind also leaps to other, more <i>Terminator</i>&#x2013; and <i>The Matrix</i>&#x2013;type fantasies, although the Turing test promises to involve <i>signifi cantly </i>fewer machine guns.) When I read that the machines came up shy of passing the 2008 test by just one single vote, and realized that 2009 might be the year they finally cross the threshold, a steely voice inside me rose up seemingly out of nowhere. <i>Not on my watch. </i><br>More than this, though, the test raises a number of questions, exciting as well as troubling, at the intersection of computer science, cognitive science, philosophy, and daily life. As someone who has studied and written about each of these areas, and who has published peer-reviewed cognitive science research, I find the Turing test par�ticularly compelling for the way it manages to draw from and connect them all. As we chatted, I told Professor Jackson that I thought I might have something rather unique to bring to the Loebner Prize, in terms of both the actual performance of being a confederate and relating that experience, along with the broader questions and issues raised by the test, to a large&nbsp; audience&#x2014;which would start what I think could be a fascinating and important conversation in the public culture at large. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to get him to agree, and soon my name was on the confederate roster. <br>After briefing me a bit on the logistics of the competition, he gave me the advice I had heard from confederates past to expect: &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not much more you need to know,&nbsp; really. You <i>are</i> human, so just be yourself.&#x201d; <br><i><br>&#x201c;Just be yourself &#x201d;</i>&#x2014;this has been, in effect, the confederate motto since the first Loebner Prize in 1991, but seems to me like a somewhat naive overconfidence in human instincts&#x2014;or at worst, fixing the fi ght. The AI programs we go up against are often the result of decades of work&#x2014;then again, so are we. But the AI research teams have huge databases of test runs of their programs, and they&#x2019;ve done statistical analysis on these archives: they know how to deftly guide the con�versation away from their shortcomings and&nbsp; toward their strengths, what conversational routes lead to deep exchange and which ones&nbsp; fizzle&#x2014;the average confederate off the street&#x2019;s instincts aren&#x2019;t likely to be so good. This is a strange and deeply interesting point, of which the perennial demand in our society for conversation, public speak�ing, and dating coaches is ample proof. The transcripts from the 2008 contest show the judges being downright apologetic to the human confederates that they can&#x2019;t make better conversation&#x2014;&#x201c;i feel sorry for the [confederates], i reckon they must be getting a bit bored talk�ing about the weather,&#x201d; one says, and another offers, meekly, &#x201c;sorry for being so banal&#x201d;&#x2014;meanwhile, the computer in the other window is apparently charming the pants off the judge, who in no time at all is gushing lol&#x2019;s and :P&#x2019;s. We can do better. <br><br>So, I must say, my intention from the start was to be as thoroughly disobedient to the organizers&#x2019; advice to &#x201c;just show up at Brighton in September and &#x2018;be myself&#x2019; &#x201d; as possible&#x2014;spending the months leading up to the test gathering as much information, preparation, and experience as possible and coming to Brighton ready to give it everything I had. <br>Ordinarily, there&nbsp; wouldn&#x2019;t be very much odd about this notion at all, of course&#x2014;we train and prepare for tennis competitions, spell�ing bees, standardized tests, and the like. But given that the Turing test is meant to evaluate <i>how human</i> I am, the implication seems to be that being human (and being oneself) is about more than simply showing up. I contend that it is. What exactly that &#x201c;more&#x201d; entails will be a main focus of this&nbsp; book&#x2014;and the answers found along the way will be applicable to a lot more in life than just the Turing test. <br><i>Falling for Ivana </i><br><br>A rather strange, and more than slightly ironic, cautionary tale: Dr. Robert Epstein, UCSD psychologist, editor of the scientifi c volume <i>Parsing the Turing Test,</i> and co-founder, with Hugh Loebner, of the Loebner Prize, subscribed to an online dating service in the winter of 2007. He began writing long letters to a Russian woman named Ivana, who would respond with long letters of her own, describing her family, her daily life, and her growing feelings for Epstein. Even�tually, though, something&nbsp; didn&#x2019;t feel right; long story short, Epstein ultimately realized that he&#x2019;d been exchanging lengthy love letters for <i>over four months </i>with&#x2014; you guessed&nbsp; it&#x2014;a computer program. Poor guy: it wasn&#x2019;t enough that web&nbsp; ruffians spam his email box every day, now they have to spam his heart? <br><br>On the one hand, I want to simply sit back and laugh at the&nbsp; guy&#x2014;he <i>founded</i> the Loebner Prize, for Christ&#x2019;s sake! What a chump! Then again, I&#x2019;m also sympathetic: the unavoidable presence of spam in the&nbsp; twenty- first century not only clogs the&nbsp; in-boxes and bandwidth of the world (roughly 97 percent of <i>all email messages</i> are spam&#x2014;we are talking tens of billions a day; you could <i>literally</i> power a small nation4&nbsp;with the amount of electricity it takes to process the world&#x2019;s daily spam), but does something arguably worse&#x2014;it erodes our sense of trust. I hate that when I get messages from my friends I have to expend at least a modicum of energy, at least for the first few sen�tences, deciding whether it&#x2019;s really <i>them</i> writing. We go through digital life, in the&nbsp; twenty-first century, with our guards up. All com�munication is a Turing test. All communication is suspect. <br><br>That&#x2019;s the pessimistic version, and here&#x2019;s the optimistic one. I&#x2019;ll bet that Epstein learned a lesson, and I&#x2019;ll bet that lesson was a lot more complicated and subtle than &#x201c;trying to start an online relationship with someone from Nizhny Novgorod was a dumb idea.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d like to think, at least, that he&#x2019;s going to have a lot of thinking to do about why it took him four months to realize that there was no actual exchange occurring between him and &#x201c;Ivana,&#x201d; and that in the future he&#x2019;ll be quicker to the&nbsp; real-human-exchange draw. And that his <i>next</i> girl�friend, who hopefully not only is a bona fi de <i>Homo sapiens</i> but also lives fewer than eleven time zones away, may have &#x201c;Ivana,&#x201d; in a weird way, to thank. <br><br><i><br>The Illegitimacy of the Figurative </i><br><br>When Claude Shannon met Betty at Bell Labs in the 1940s, she was indeed a computer. If this sounds odd to us in any way, it&#x2019;s worth knowing that nothing at all seemed odd about it to them. Nor to their&nbsp; co-workers: to their Bell Labs colleagues their romance was a perfectly normal one, typical even. Engineers and computers wooed all the time. <br>It was Alan Turing&#x2019;s 1950 paper &#x201c;Computing Machinery and Intel�ligence&#x201d; that launched the field of AI as we know it and ignited the conversation and controversy over the Turing test (or the &#x201c;Imita�tion Game,&#x201d; as Turing initially called it) that has continued to this day&#x2014;but modern &#x201c;computers&#x201d; are nothing like the &#x201c;computers&#x201d; of Turing&#x2019;s time. In the early twentieth century, before a &#x201c;computer&#x201d; was one of the digital processing devices that so proliferate in our&nbsp; twenty- first- century&nbsp; lives&#x2014; in our offices, in our homes, in our cars, and, increasingly, in our&nbsp; pockets&#x2014;it was something else: a job description. <br><br>From the&nbsp; mid-eighteenth century onward, computers, frequently women, were on the payrolls of corporations, engineering fi rms, and universities, performing calculations and doing numerical analysis, sometimes with the use of a rudimentary calculator. These original, human computers were behind the calculations for everything from the first accurate predictions for the return of Halley&#x2019;s comet&#x2014;early proof of Newton&#x2019;s theory of gravity, which had only been checked against planetary orbits before&#x2014;to the Manhattan Project, where Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman oversaw a group of human computers at Los Alamos. <br><br>It&#x2019;s amazing to look back at some of the earliest papers in computer science, to see the authors attempting to explain, for the fi rst time, what exactly these new contraptions were.

In 1853, a Kentucky deputy sheriff named Zebulon Ward colluded with Wood's employer, abducted her, and sold her back into bondage. She remained enslaved throughout the Civil War, giving birth to a son in Mississippi and never forgetting who had put her in this position. <br><br>By 1869, Wood had obtained her freedom for a second time and returned to Cincinnati, where she sued Ward for damages in 1870. Astonishingly, after eight years of litigation, Wood won her case: in 1878, a Federal jury awarded her $2,500. The decision stuck on appeal. More important than the amount, though the largest ever awarded by an American court in restitution for slavery, was the fact that any money was awarded at all. By the time the case was decided, Ward had become a wealthy businessman and a pioneer of convict leasing in the South. Wood's son later became a prominent Chicago lawyer, and she went on to live until 1912. <br><br>McDaniel's book is an epic tale of a black woman who survived slavery twice and who achieved more than merely a moral victory over one of her oppressors. Above all, <em>Sweet Taste of Liberty</em> is a portrait of an extraordinary individual as well as a searing reminder of the lessons of her story, which establish beyond question the connections between slavery and the prison system that rose in its place.<br></p><p><br><strong>W. Caleb McDaniel </strong>is Associate Professor of History at Rice University<br><br>"In this gripping study, Rice University historian McDaniel recounts the painful but triumphant story of one enslaved woman's long fight for justice... McDaniel tells this story engrossingly and accessibly. This is a valuable contribution to Reconstruction history with clear relevance to current debates about reparations for slavery."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"<em>Sweet Taste of Liberty</em> is a masterpiece. Using an extraordinary archival discovery, McDaniel expertly weaves a compelling, fine-grained narrative of the extraordinary life of Henrietta Wood. . . . But this is not simply a biography. It also a work of profound analysis, layered with McDaniel's deep knowledge of slavery, emancipation, and the law. The book raises the most profound questions about slavery, reparations, and the debt that the United States owes to the people whose unfree labor constructed a great deal of that nation." -- Gregory P. Downs, author of <em>The Second American Revolution:</em> <em>The Civil War-Era Struggle over Cuba and the Rebirth of the American Republic</em><p></p><br>"As America grapples with reparations for slavery, Caleb McDaniel unearths the astounding story of a woman who survived bondage, twice, and fought for restitution against impossible odds. In lucid and vivid prose, he brings us a chilling, inspiring, and timely examination of both the necessity and complexity of redressing historical crimes." -- Tony Horwitz, author of <em>Confederates in the Attic</em> and <em>Spying on the South</em><p></p><br>"Henrietta Wood's quest to be made whole by seeking reparations from the man who kidnapped and re-enslaved her is a heart-tugging page-turner. With fidelity to the historical record and insight into the emotions that run through it, Caleb McDaniel's <em>Sweet Taste of Liberty</em> tells how enslaved women lived along the jagged lines that divided house and field, city and countryside, North and South, and slavery and freedom. Her triumph is a tribute to one woman's persistence, courage, legal savvy, and an enduring devotion to family-its lessons for us are timeless." -- Martha S. Jones, Society of Black Alumni Presidential Professor, Johns Hopkins University, author of <em>Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America</em><p></p><br>"McDaniel renders an enthralling biography of a determined, resilient woman... A well-researched, well-told story that also contributes to the debate about reparations." <br>--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"<em>Sweet Taste of Liberty</em> is a profound book that could not have been released at a better time...

The outsized reputations of the best-known figures from the period&#x2014;Michelangelo, Niccolo Machiavelli, Lorenzo the Magnificent, Pope Julius II, Isabella d'Este, and so many others&#x2014;engender a kind of wonder. How could so many geniuses or exceptional characters be produced by one small territory near the extreme south of Europe at a moment when much of the rest of the continent still labored under the restrictions of the Middle Ages? How did so many of the driving principles behind Western civilization emerge during this period&#x2014;and how were they defined and developed? And why is it that geniuses such as Leonardo, Raphael, Petrarch, Brunelleschi, Bramante, and Palladio all sustain their towering authority to this day?<br> &nbsp;<br> To answer these questions, Kenneth Bartlett delves into the lives and works of the artists, patrons, and intellectuals&#x2014;the privileged, educated, influential elites&#x2014;who created a rarefied world of power, money, and sophisticated talent in which individual curiosity and skill were prized above all else. The result is a dynamic, highly readable, copiously illustrated history of the Renaissance in Italy&#x2014;and of the artists that gave birth to some of the most enduring ideas and artifacts of Western civilization.</p><p><b>Kenneth Bartlett</b> is Professor of History and Renaissance Studies at Victoria College, University of Toronto. &nbsp;He is the author, editor, or translator of seven books, including, most recently, <i>Florence in the Age of the Medici and Savonarola, 1464-1498</i> (Hackett, 2018).

Bartlett presents a survey of glittering cultural, literary, and artistic achievements, never losing sight of the important political contexts in which they&nbsp;were made. The whole sweep of the Italian Renaissance&#x2014;the fabulous wealth of its merchants, the ruthless schemes of its princes, the high ideals of its poets and writers, the astonishing works of its artists and architects, the struggles of its visionaries and reformers&#x2014;comes into focus."<br> &#x2014;Margaret Meserve, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"Bartlett looks at the Renaissance in a new and original way. Instead of tracing a history of the Renaissance in Italy, as do most of the studies available today, Bartlett's book is focused on key people and city states, from Petrarch and his era to the 'End of the Renaissance in Rome,' during the pontificate of Pope Sixtus V from 1585 to 1590. The twenty-two chapters are exhaustive and provide an excellent and novel view of the Italian Renaissance. This book is well thought out, clearly developed, and beautifully written. I recommend it to anyone interested in the culture of one of the most interesting periods of early modern European history."<br> &#x2014;Massimo Ciavolella, University of California, Los Angeles<br> &nbsp;<br><br>"A lively study informed by the latest international scholarship. Building on his years of experience as a teacher and a guide for travelers to Italy, Bartlett has created a well-written and up-to-date history of the high culture of the period, 'an exploration of the Italian Renaissance guided by particular moments and men&#x2014;and a few remarkable women.' Bartlett shows how the unique artistic and cultural flowering of the Renaissance fit with the interests and outlooks of the elites who dominated the various Italian cities. His case studies range well beyond the usual Florentine and Roman experiences to include many of the smaller, but equally exciting, courts of northern and central Italy. The studies themselves are freestanding and could easily be used by travelers as introductions to these various cities."<br> &#x2014;Duane Osheim, The University of Virginia</p><h2>New York: Portrait of a City-Portrat einer Stadt-Portrait d&#39;une ville</h2><p><p>This book presents the epic story of New York on nearly 600 pages of emotional, atmospheric photographs, from the mid-19th century to the present day. Supplementing this treasure trove of images are over a hundred quotations and references from relevant books, movies, shows, and songs. The city&#x2019;s fluctuating fortunes are all represented, from the wild nights of the Jazz Age and the hedonistic disco era, to the grim days of the Depression and the devastation of 9/11 and its aftermath, as its brokenhearted but unbowed citizens picked up the pieces.</p><p>New York&#x2019;s remarkable rise, reinvention, and growth are not just the tale of a city, but the story of a nation, From the building of the Brooklyn Bridge to the immigrants arriving at Ellis Island; from the slums of the Lower East Side to the magnificent art deco skyscrapers. The urban beach of Coney Island and the sleaze of Times Square; the vistas of Central Park and the crowds on Fifth Avenue. The streets, the sidewalks, the chaos, the energy, the ethnic diversity, the culture, the fashion, the architecture, the anger, and the complexity of the city are all laid out in this beautiful book. This is the greatest city in the world after all and great are its extremes, contradictions, and attitude.</p><p>More than just a remarkable tribute to the metropolis and its civic, social, and photographic heritage, New York: Portrait of a City pays homage to the indomitable spirit of those who call themselves New Yorkers: full of hope and strength, resolute in their determination to succeed among its glass and granite towers.</p><p>Features hundreds of iconic images, sourced from dozens of archives and private collections&#x2015;many never before published&#x2015;and the work of over 150 celebrated photographers, including Victor Prevost, Jacob Riis, Lewis Hine, Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, Berenice Abbott, Walker Evans, Weegee, Margaret Bourke-White, Saul Leiter, Esther Bubley, Arnold Newman, William Claxton, Ralph Gibson, Ryan McGinley, Mitch Epstein, Steve Schapiro, Marvin Newman, Allen Ginsberg, Joel Meyerowitz, Andreas Feininger, Charles Cushman, Joseph Rodriguez, Garry Winogrand, Larry Fink, Jamel Shabazz, Allan Tannenbaum, Bruce Davidson, Helen Levitt, Eugene de Salignac, Ruth Orkin, Joel Sternfeld, Keizo Kitajima, and many more.</p></p><p>Reuel Golden is the former editor of the British Journal of Photography.

You can learn about her travels, literary and otherwise, at KatZhangWriter.com.Emperor's Riddle <br> <br>1<br> <br>DEEP IN THE CLOSET OF the master bedroom, buried beneath piles of winter blankets and heavy coats, was an old leather trunk. It might have been bright red once upon a time. But the years had patched it with stains and lighter portions where the leather had worn away. <br> <br>Mia helped Aunt Lin lug the trunk from the closet, each of them grabbing a dark metal handle. The trunk was heavier than it looked, and Mia was already noodle-�armed from jet lag. She&#x2019;d arrived in China less than twenty-four hours ago, and most of that time had been spent in transit&#x2014;taking the train from Shanghai to Fuzhou, and then the taxi here, to this apartment. Her eyes kept slipping shut, trying to remind her that while it was midafternoon in Fuzhou, it was the middle of the night back in America.<br> <br>Once the trunk was out in the open, Mia saw that it was nearly large enough for her to climb inside. An image came to her&#x2014;a snapshot of her curled in the trunk like a sleeping fairy, waiting for someone to wake her. Or maybe bound like a prisoner, straining at the rope around her wrists. That was the more exciting story, the kind Mia usually liked. But right now, sleeping for a hundred years sounded like the better option.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lost in your head again?&#x201d; Aunt Lin smiled and brushed a strand of hair from Mia&#x2019;s face, bringing her back from her imaginings. &#x201c;Come, let&#x2019;s see what&#x2019;s in this thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>She rummaged around the nightstand until she produced an ancient-looking key. Mia was surprised her aunt still knew her way around. Aunt Lin and Mia&#x2019;s mother had grown up in this apartment, but it had been years and years since they&#x2019;d been here last.<br> <br>Mia had expected them to feel like she did&#x2014;a puzzle piece that didn&#x2019;t fit. <br> <br>Glum again, she pulled her knees against her chest. This month-long visit to China was supposed to be a Great Opportunity for Mia and her older brother, Jake, to see where their family had come from. The last time they&#x2019;d visited, Mia had been so little she barely remembered it.<br> <br>You loved it, Mia&#x2019;s mother had said. You had so much fun.<br> <br>But back then, Mia hadn&#x2019;t met Thea and Lizbeth yet. She hadn&#x2019;t cared that the trip would rip her from home for a third of summer vacation. The three of them hadn&#x2019;t spent a summer apart in years. Mia would make it back just in time to celebrate her twelfth birthday, but that wasn&#x2019;t much consolation.<br> <br>A month was a long time to be apart from your best friends. <br> <br>Anything might happen.<br> <br>Aunt Lin sat and tucked an arm around Mia so they sloped against each other. &#x201c;Do you want to open it?&#x201d; she said, holding out the key. She grinned, like they were explorers&#x2014;or maybe adventurous archaeologists, having just unearthed a treasure. She knew how much Mia enjoyed mysteries.<br> <br>The lock turned with a satisfying click. Mia opened the lid slowly and peeked inside.<br> <br>The first thing she saw was a big, square book. It wasn&#x2019;t until she laid it open in her lap that she realized it wasn&#x2019;t a book at all, but a photo album. Inside, the photos weren&#x2019;t slipped into plastic pockets, but pasted onto black paper pages, like a scrapbook. <br> <br>&#x201c;Can you recognize your mother and me in any of those?&#x201d; Aunt Lin said. She was lifting other things out of the trunk&#x2014;a small frame of embroidered silk, a slender, cloth-wrapped vase. For a minute, Mia was too distracted to look at the album. <br> <br>But she couldn&#x2019;t keep her eyes away for long. She squinted at each picture. Some were tiny, barely bigger than a postage stamp. Others were the size of her palm. All were black-and-white, though a couple looked like someone had tried to color them in afterward and hadn&#x2019;t done a very good job. <br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Mom,&#x201d; Mia said, pointing at a family photo. <br> <br>Her mother and Aunt Lin bookended a collection of four children, Aunt Lin the eldest, Mia&#x2019;s mother the baby. In the photograph, all four siblings gathered in a solemn huddle around the seated forms of Mia&#x2019;s late grandmother and grandfather. Her mother was barely more than a toddler, but she had the same sweet, round face she had now. <br> <br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s you, with the braids.&#x201d; This time, Mia pointed at the eldest child. The girl was maybe fourteen&#x2014;�around Jake&#x2019;s age. There was a familiar glint in her dark eyes, as if she were thinking of a joke. <br> <br>On the next page, Mia found a picture of just the two of them&#x2014;her mother and Aunt Lin holding hands and laughing at the camera. This time her mom looked to be four or five. <br> <br>&#x201c;That was the first day of my senior year of high school,&#x201d; Aunt Lin said. &#x201c;One of your grandmother&#x2019;s friends borrowed a camera from someone.&#x201d;<br> <br>She smiled and took the photo album in her careful, life-weathered hands. &#x201c;Life-weathered&#x201d; was a term Mia had learned from Aunt Lin, since no one but Aunt Lin used it. Her aunt liked to mash English words together, or substitute one word in a common phrase for another that suited her better. You understand what I mean, she&#x2019;d say, and Mia always did.<br> <br>The two of them weren&#x2019;t like the rest of the people in Mia&#x2019;s little family. They weren&#x2019;t like Mia&#x2019;s mom, who was always punctual, and loved to-do lists, and never let her thoughts wander off when they were supposed to be pinned down. They weren&#x2019;t like Jake, who did well in school without even trying, who always had people inviting him over to play basketball, or soccer, or tennis. <br> <br>They weren&#x2019;t like Mia&#x2019;s dad, who&#x2019;d left one day when Mia was little and never came back.<br> <br>They were only like each other. Cotton-candy-headed, as Mia&#x2019;s mom sometimes teased; Weird, as Jake always complained. They loved stories and history and make-believe&#x2014;�and the exciting places where those things blurred into one another.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Aunt Lin said. &#x201c;This is a picture of me during the Chinese New Year. I was nineteen&#x2014;it was my first time home after being sent down to the countryside.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mia studied the picture. It was hard to tell in the black-and-white photo, but her aunt looked heavily tanned. Her hair was still in braids, her smile secret and winking. <br> <br>When a younger Mia had first heard her aunt&#x2019;s stories about her years in the countryside, she&#x2019;d thought they sounded pretty exciting. Mia didn&#x2019;t have a head for school. She daydreamed through math and English classes alike, distracted by every passing noise in the hallway. Her teachers were always telling her to sit still, to keep her eyes forward. <br> <br>To think about something that wasn&#x2019;t fantasy.<br> <br>She thought she would have preferred tramping around outdoors every day, planting baby rice shoots, or hand-making bricks, or threshing wheat. She&#x2019;d helped out at Thea&#x2019;s horse barn before, and that had been fun, the two of them giggling through their tasks and getting straw in their hair. <br> <br>But she knew Aunt Lin had wanted to go straight to university after high school. She&#x2019;d dreamed of becoming a history professor&#x2014;not of being stuck doing farm work in rural China. She&#x2019;d been there nearly three years before being allowed to come home again. Only then had she applied for university. <br> <br>&#x201c;Were you homesick?&#x201d; Mia said. &#x201c;When you were down in the country?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Aunt Lin said. &#x201c;I missed my old friends. I missed my family&#x2014;especially your mother! She was my little darling.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mia always felt funny when she tried to think of her mother as a child&#x2014;small enough to be someone&#x2019;s little darling. She was so grown up now. <br> <br>&#x201c;Ah! Here it is.&#x201d; Aunt Lin had gotten to the bottom of the trunk, and she lifted something swathed in layers of cloth. Mia pressed closer as her aunt undid the wrappings.<br> <br>It was a Chinese brush painting of two black-and-white cranes. One had its wings lifted wide, as if in a dance. The other stared at the sky, its long neck curved in a sinuous S. Both bore a flash of red at the crowns of their delicate heads. Behind them stretched a rolling landscape of mountain peaks and valleys, cut through by a winding stream.<br> <br>Aunt Lin sat back on her knees, the painting in her lap. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen this in a long, long time. It was your grandmother&#x2019;s favorite painting. She used to hang it in her bedroom, right there&#x2014;&#x201d; She pointed to an empty spot on the wall by the closet door. &#x201c;That way, she could see it every morning when she got out of bed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mia&#x2019;s grandparents had passed away long ago. She&#x2019;d never even met them. Sometimes her mother or Aunt Lin would bring them up&#x2014;say things like, Oh, remember what Mom used to do? or Dad always liked those, but mostly, Mia&#x2019;s grandparents were a mystery to her. The majority of her extended family was. <br> <br>She tried to picture the woman her grandmother had been once upon a time. Someone who&#x2019;d loved these dainty cranes so much she&#x2019;d hung them in her bedroom. Someone who&#x2019;d breathed and hummed and walked through this apartment, her feet pressed against the same floors Mia sat on now. <br> <br>&#x201c;Did Uncle take the painting down after she died?&#x201d; Mia asked. Only her uncle still lived in this apartment. Aunt Lin and Mia&#x2019;s mother had moved to the United States long ago, and their remaining sister lived hours away, in another city. <br> <br>Aunt Lin shook her head. &#x201c;Your grandmother took it down herself. I think I was in middle school then, or maybe high school. This painting is a family heirloom&#x2014;it&#x2019;s very old and very precious. It&#x2019;s a piece of history.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Was she afraid someone would break it?&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a beat of silence before Aunt Lin answered. &#x201c;There was a time when no one in China wanted anything to do with things that were old, and precious, and pieces of history,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Or if they did&#x2014;they kept quiet about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The room grew still. Mia got the shivery, unsettled feeling she always did when her aunt&#x2019;s mood dipped. Aunt Lin was seldom sad, but when she did get that way, it felt like doors closing in Mia&#x2019;s face. Like her aunt withdrew somewhere deep inside herself, where Mia couldn&#x2019;t follow. <br> <br>Mia hated that more than anything. Even more than when Aunt Lin got overly excited about something and wandered off. At least then Mia could think of her aunt as a daredevil traveler&#x2014;a swashbuckling heroine like those in Mia&#x2019;s favorite books. Besides, Aunt Lin always warned Mia before leaving on one of her sudden journeys, even if she forgot to tell anyone else.<br> <br>The one time she hadn&#x2019;t, Mia had cried every day Aunt Lin was gone. Your aunt has always been like this, her mother had said in an attempt to comfort her. She gets hooked by something&#x2014;a new exhibition on tombs, a talk about ancient kings&#x2014;and forgets everything else. Don&#x2019;t worry. She always finds her way back.<br> <br>But this had happened only months after Mia&#x2019;s parents had divorced; Mia had been very little. She hadn&#x2019;t believed that anyone who&#x2019;d leave so abruptly would come home again.<br> <br>Once she returned a few days later, Aunt Lin had sworn up and down that she&#x2019;d never again take off without leaving Mia a message. That she&#x2019;d never be gone when Mia needed her.<br> <br>In all the years since, she&#x2019;d never broken that promise.<br> <br>Mia rested her chin against her aunt&#x2019;s shoulder and racked her brain for something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;helpful to say. Something that would bring her aunt back to her. &#x201c;Can we take the painting with us when we leave? If your brother doesn&#x2019;t want it? You could hang it in your bedroom at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>To her relief, Aunt Lin laughed. &#x201c;Maybe we can. But it&#x2019;s far too early to talk about leaving&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve only just arrived. Did you want to see where my school used to be? Or the park where your mother liked to play when she was little?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mia just hugged Aunt Lin even tighter. &#x201c;Will you take me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Aunt Lin said. She kissed the top of Mia&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to spend this whole trip together. I promise.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Wilderness Hunter</h2><p>For a number of years much of my life was spent either in the wilderness or on the borders of the settled country if, indeed, &#34;settled&#34; is a term that can rightly be applied to the vast, scantily peopled regions where cattle-ranching is the only regular industry. During this time I hunted much, among the mountains and on the plains, both as a pastime and to procure hides, meat, and robes for use on the ranch; and it was my good luck to kill all the various kinds of large game that can properly be considered to belong to temperate North America. In hunting, the finding and killing of the game is after all but a part of the whole. The free, self-reliant, adventurous life, with its rugged and stalwart democracy; the wild surroundings, the grand beauty of the scenery, the chance to study the ways and habits of the woodland creatures all these unite to give to the career of the wilderness hunter its peculiar charm. The chase is among the best of all national pastimes; it cultivates that vigorous manliness for the lack of which in a nation, as in an individual, the possession of no other qualities can possibly atone. No one, but he who has partaken thereof, can understand the keen delight of hunting in lonely lands. For him is the joy of the horse well ridden and the rifle well held; for him the long days of toil and hardship, resolutely endured, and crowned at the end with triumph. In after years there shall come forever to his mind the memory of endless prairies shimmering in the bright sun; of vast snow-clad wastes lying desolate under gray skies; of the melancholy marshes; of the rush of mighty rivers; of the breath of the ever-green forest in summer; of the crooning of ice-armored pines at the touch of the winds of winter; of cataracts roaring between hoar mountain masses; of all the innumerable sights and sounds of the wilderness; of its immensity and mystery; and of the silences that brood in its still depths.

King illuminates the hidden corners of her beloved Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes series in this dynamic short story collection.</p><p>Laurie R. King has been writing crime fiction since 1987 and won many awards for her work in fiction including the prestigious John Creasey Dagger, the Edgar, the Nero and Macavity Awards. Her background includes such diverse interests as Old Testament theology and construction work, and she is the author of highly praised stand-alone suspense novels and a contemporary mystery series, as well as the Mary Russell &amp; Sherlock Holmes series. She lives in North California."Here King assembles previously published stories, half of them available only electronically until now, and a new one; together, the stories trace the relationship of this long-lived literary couple. Suspense is secondary to delight here as readers learn more of the activities of Russell and Holmes. A treat for the series legion of fans." (Michele Leber <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"Fans of King&#x2019;s Mary Russell novels, which starting with 1994&#x2019;s <i>The Beekeeper&#x2019;s Apprentice</i> chart her relationship with Sherlock Holmes, will welcome this collection, which includes extracts from the novels, short stories, and the diary that Mary kept as a teen during WWI. Readers will learn about Mary&#x2019;s wily Uncle Jake, Holmes&#x2019;s marriage proposal, the couple&#x2019;s eccentric wedding, and Mycroft Holmes&#x2019;s political activities....The heart of the book, however, is Mary&#x2019;s wartime diary, punctuated by headlines announcing war casualties and<br><br>zeppelin attacks and interspersed with Mary&#x2019;s not always kind assessment of the periodical installments of <i>The Valley of Fear</i>, the last Holmes novel.

In her tightly woven, well-researched biography of the Texas hero, she has demystified Sam Houston by presenting the facts of his life and providing interpretations. Her writing turns this larger-than-life character into a very real person. Houston was a self-educated man who fought in the War of 1812, served as a congressman and governor of Tennessee, fought for Texas independence, served as its first president and later as governor and senator after Texas joined the union. Much of his life was influenced by his boyhood reading of hero stories, especially those of Caius Marius, a Roman general and statesman. Fritz does not glide over Houston's weaknesses such as his problem with alcohol and his marriage to an Indian woman when still married to another woman. She delights in recounting Houston's dramatic flair. He stole the show from Mirabeau B. Lamar, elected to replace him as president of Texas, on his inauguration day by arriving dressed as George Washington and proceeding to give a three hour farewell address to the extreme consternation of Lamar. Other biographies of Houston have joined the ranks of o.p., but even collections that still have them should make room on their shelves for this splendid biography.Therese Bigelow, Hampton Public Library, Va.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Visit to the Dinosaurs (Let&#39;s-Read-and-Find-Out Science 2)</h2><p><p>Dinosaurs are extinct now, but you can visit dinosaur skeletons in a museum. There you will meet Brachiosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Diplodocus and learn how they ruled the earth millions of years ago. You'll see dinosaurs with over 1,000 teeth, dinosaurs who could swim, meat-eaters and plant-eaters. And, of course, you'll meet the king of all dinosaurs, the gigantic Tyrannosaurus rex.</p></p><p><p>With more than 60 fiction and nonfiction titles for children to her credit, Aliki has been delighting her many fans since her first book was published in 1960. Born in New Jersey, she now lives in New York City.</p><p>Aliki's books for young readers include the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out titles <em>Digging Up Dinosaurs</em>, <em>Fossils Tell of Long Ago</em>, <em>My Feet</em>, and <em>My Hands</em>. Other nonfiction books by Aliki include <em>How a Book Is Made</em>, <em>Mummies Made in Egypt</em>, <em>My Visit to the Aquarium</em>, <em>My Visit to the Dinosaurs</em>, <em>My Visit to the Zoo</em>, <em>Wild and Woolly Mammoths</em>, and <em>William Shakespeare &amp; the Globe</em>.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2 Like the original edition, this book introduces young children to dinosaurs through a visit to a natural history museum. The simple text explains how paleontologists discovered dinosaur bones and reconstructed the reptiles' skeletons from their fossilized remains. Also included are brief descriptions of the more well-known dinosaurs, accompanied by full-color illustrations of the creatures as they once appeared. The text of this edition varies little from that of the earlier book. It's the new illustrations that make this revision worth purchasing; Aliki's clear, full-color pictures provide just enough detail to maintain young children's interest without confusing them. Similar in content to Parish's Dinosaur Time (Harper, 1974) and Milton's Dinosaur Days (Random, 1985), Aliki's book is slanted more toward a young listening audience rather than beginning readers. Along with Aliki's Digging Up Dinosaurs (1981) and Fossils Tell of Long Ago (1972, both Crowell), this book gives preschoolers an excellent introduction to paleontology and to the giant reptiles of long ago.

Fineberg, President of the Institute of Medicine</b><br><br>For decades, experts have puzzled over why the US spends more on health care but suffers poorer outcomes than other industrialized nations. Now Elizabeth H. Bradley and Lauren A. Taylor marshal extensive research, including a comparative study of health care data from thirty countries, and get to the root of this paradox: We've left out of our tally the most impactful expenditures countries make to improve the health of their populations investments in social services. <br><br>In <i>The American Health Care Paradox</i>, Bradley and Taylor illuminate how narrow definitions of health care,&#x201d; archaic divisions in the distribution of health and social services, and our allergy to government programs combine to create needless suffering in individual lives, even as health care spending continues to soar. They show us how and why the US health care system&#x201d; developed as it did; examine the constraints on, and possibilities for, reform; and profile inspiring new initiatives from around the world. <br><br>Offering a unique and clarifying perspective on the problems the Affordable Care Act won't solve, this book also points a new way forward. <br></p><p><b>Elizabeth H.

In short, Americans pay top dollar for hospitals, physicians, medications, and diagnostic testing but skimp in broad areas that are central to health such as housing, clean water, safe food, education, and other social services. It may even be that Americans spend large sums in health care to compensate for what they do not fund in social care and the tradeoff is not good for the country&#x2019;s health....<br><br>Physicians, many of whom see almost 30 patients per day, are increasingly aware that unmet social needs are essential contributors to worse health for Americans, and that they generate substantial costs within the medical system. In a recent national survey of 1,000 primary care physicians by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, eighty-five percent agreed that patients&#x2019; unmet social needs lead directly to worse health and that those needs are as important to address as patients&#x2019; medical conditions.<br><br>Physicians further reported that if they had the power to write prescriptions to address social needs, these prescriptions would represent one of every seven they write. Top social needs were noted as fitness (by 75% of respondents), nutritious food (by 64% of respondents), employment assistance (52% of respondents), education (49% of respondents), and housing (43% of respondents).<br><br>Among physicians we interviewed, many expressed frustration that medical tools do not address the most important drivers of poor health.

The story begins in 1936 as 19-year-old Tobias is thumbing his way from Remus, Mich., to his uncle's farm in Glen Rose, Tex., to find a hidden bag of money, after his father, a Baptist pastor, drunkenly slams his car into the church and is removed from the parsonage. The author does an excellent job in making well-charted territory (riding the rails; scavenged campfire meals under the stars) seem&nbsp;vibrant and new. Snippets of scripture, Southern spirituals, and folk ballads lend context and flavor to the text. Most impressive are the jangly dialogue and the characters'&nbsp;distinctive voices, which are&nbsp;authentic and earthy&nbsp;but not remotely hoary.

Like post-Columbus America, it sprouts from Biblical seeds and then spreads its railroad-track branches from a preacher's pulpit in Michigan, through a St Louis brothel, and into a Texas ranch. We experience the odyssey of a young man who searches for lost treasure, his identity, and the alchemy of transforming lust to love. We are enchanted by a young woman who, like the land itself, is protected by the spirit of an Indian warrior. We meet a cast of characters so beautifully developed they might have sprung from the synchronized pens of great American novelists like Twain, Steinbeck, Faulkner, Wolfe (both of them), and Robbins. One of those characters, a Socrates-invoking hobo, tells us that 'myths and fairy tales aren't lies--they're deeper truths.'

Desperate to outrun grief, Alice flees to the dramatically beautiful central Australian desert.

When she was nine years old, her family lived in a camper van for two years in North America, travelling from one national park to another, an experience that sparked Holly&#x2019;s lifelong interest in cultures and stories. In her twenties, Holly worked for four years in a remote Indigenous community in the central Australian desert. She moved to England in 2009 and obtained her MA in Creative Writing from the University of Manchester in 2011. She now lives between the UK and Australia, and is in the final year of her creative writing Ph.D. with Griffith University and King&#x2019;s College London. Her Ph.D. project examines how traumatic experience can be reformed through the creative writing process. Holly&#x2019;s essays and short fiction have been published in various anthologies and literary journals. In 2015, the first chapter of <em>The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart</em> (then called <em>The Centre is Red</em>) won Griffith Review&#x2019;s annual writer award, which included a weeklong fellowship at Varuna House, Australia&#x2019;s prestigious writing residency.</p><strong>Flannel flower </strong><br><br> Meaning: <strong>What is lost is found </strong><br><br> <em>Actinotus helianthi</em> | New South Wales <br> <p>The stem, branches and leaves of the plant are a pale grey in colour, covered in downy hair, and flannel-like in texture. Pretty, daisy-shaped flowers bloom in spring, though flowering may be profuse after bushfires.</p> *<br> <p>The first story Alice ever learned began on the edge of darkness, where her newborn screams restarted her mother&#x2019;s heart.</p> <p>The night she was born, a subtropical storm had blown in from the east and caused king tides to flood the river banks, cutting off the lane between the Harts&#x2019; property and town. Stranded in the laneway with her water broken and a band of fire seemingly cutting her in half, Agnes Hart pushed life and a daughter out of her body on the back seat of her husband&#x2019;s truck. Clem Hart, consumed by panic as the storm boomed over the cane fields, was at first too frantic swaddling his newborn to notice his wife&#x2019;s pallor. When he saw her face turn white as sand, her lips the shade of a pipi shell, Clem fell upon her in a frenzy, forgetting their baby. He shook Agnes, to no avail. It wasn&#x2019;t until her daughter screamed that Agnes was jolted to consciousness. On either side of the laneway, rain-soaked bushes burst into a flurry of white flowers. Alice&#x2019;s first breaths were filled with lightning and the scent of storm lilies in bloom.</p> <p> <em>You were the true love I needed to wake me from a curse, Bun,</em> her mother would say to finish the story. <em>You&#x2019;re my fairytale.</em></p> <p>When Alice was two years old, Agnes introduced her to books; as she read, she pointed to each word on the page. Down at the beach, she repeated: one cuttlefish, two feathers, three pieces of driftwood, four shells, and five shards of sea glass. Around their house, Agnes&#x2019;s hand-lettered signs: BOOK. CHAIR. WINDOW. DOOR. TABLE. CUP. BATH. BED. By the time Alice started homeschooling when she was five, she was reading by herself. Though her love of books was swift and absolute, Alice always loved her mother&#x2019;s storytelling more. When they were alone, Agnes spun stories around the two of them. But never in earshot of Alice&#x2019;s father.</p> <p>Their ritual was to walk to the sea and lay on the sand staring up at the sky. With her mother&#x2019;s gentle voice telling the way, they took winter train trips across Europe, through landscapes with mountains so tall you couldn&#x2019;t see their tops, and ridges so smothered in snow you couldn&#x2019;t see the line separating the white sky from white earth. They wore velvet coats in the cobblestoned city of a tattooed king, where the harbour buildings were as colourful as a box of paints, and a mermaid sat, cast in bronze, forever awaiting love. Alice often closed her eyes, imagining that every thread in her mother&#x2019;s stories might spin them into the centre of a chrysalis, from which they could emerge and fly away.</p> <p>When Alice was six years old, her mother tucked her into her bed one evening, leant forward and whispered in her ear. <em>It&#x2019;s time, Bun.</em> She sat back smiling as she pulled up the covers. <em>You&#x2019;re old enough now to help me in my garden.</em> Alice squirmed with excitement; her mother usually left her with a book while she gardened alone. <em>We&#x2019;ll start tomorrow,</em> Agnes said before she turned out the light. Repeatedly through the night, Alice woke to peer through the dark windows. At last she saw the first thread of light in the sky and threw her sheets back.</p> <p>Alice&#x2019;s mother was in the kitchen making Vegemite and cottage cheese on toast and a pot of honeyed tea, which she carried on a tray outside to her garden alongside the house. The air was cool, the early sun was warm. Her mother rested the tray on a mossy tree stump and poured sweet tea into two teacups. They sat chewing and drinking in silence. Alice&#x2019;s pulse beat loudly in her temples. After Agnes ate the last of her toast and finished her tea, she crouched between her ferns and flowers, murmuring as if she was rousing sleeping children. Alice wasn&#x2019;t sure what to do. Was this gardening? She mimicked her mother and sat with the plants, watching.</p> <p>Slowly, the lines of worry in her mother&#x2019;s face vanished. Her furrowed brow relaxed. She didn&#x2019;t wring her hands, or fidget. Her eyes were full and clear. She became someone Alice didn&#x2019;t recognise. Her mother was peaceful. She was calm. The sight filled Alice with the kind of green hope she found at the bottom of rock pools at low tide but never managed to cup in her hands.</p> <p>The more time she spent with her mother in the garden, the more deeply Alice understood &#x2015; from the tilt of Agnes&#x2019;s wrist when she inspected a new bud, to the light that reached her eyes when she lifted her chin, and the thin rings of dirt that encircled her fingers as she coaxed new fern fronds from the soil &#x2015; the truest parts of her mother bloomed among her plants. Especially when she talked to the flowers. Her eyes glazed over and she mumbled in a secret language, a word here, a phrase there as she snapped flowers off their stems and tucked them into her pockets.</p> <p><em>Sorrowful remembrance,</em> she&#x2019;d say as she plucked a bindweed flower from its vine. <em>Love, returned.</em> The citrusy scent of lemon myrtle would fill the air as she tore it from a branch. <em>Pleasures of memory.</em> Her mother pocketed a scarlet palm of kangaroo paw.</p> <p>Questions scratched at the back of Alice&#x2019;s throat. Why did her mother&#x2019;s words only flow when she was telling stories about other places and other worlds? What about their world, right in front of them? Where did she go when her eyes were far away? Why couldn&#x2019;t Alice go with her?</p> <p>By her seventh birthday, Alice&#x2019;s body was heavy from the burden of unanswered questions. They filled her chest. Why did her mother talk to the native flowers in such cryptic ways? How could her father be two different people? What curse did Alice&#x2019;s first tears save her mother from? Although they weighed on her mind, Alice&#x2019;s questions remained stuck, lodged in her windpipe as painfully as if she&#x2019;d swallowed a seedpod. Moments of opportunity came on good days in the garden, when the light fell just so, yet Alice said nothing. In silence, she followed her mother as her pockets filled with flowers.</p> <p>If Agnes ever noticed Alice&#x2019;s silence, she never said anything to break it. It was understood time spent in the garden was quiet time. <em>Like a library,</em> her mother once mused as she glided through her maidenhair ferns. Though Alice hadn&#x2019;t ever been to a library &#x2015; to see more books in one place than she could imagine, or hear the whispers of collective pages turning &#x2015; she felt she almost had, through her mother&#x2019;s stories. From Agnes&#x2019;s description, Alice imagined a library must be a quiet garden of books, where stories grew like flowers.</p> <p>Alice hadn&#x2019;t been anywhere else beyond their property either. Her life was confined to its boundaries: from her mother&#x2019;s garden to the where the cane fields started, to the bay where the sea curled close by. She was forbidden to venture further than those lines, and especially the one that separated their driveway from the lane that led into town. <em>It&#x2019;s no place for a girl,</em> her father would say, slamming his fist on the dinner table, making the plates and cutlery jump, whenever Alice&#x2019;s mother suggested sending her to school. <em>She&#x2019;s safer here,</em> he&#x2019;d growl, putting an end to the conversation. That&#x2019;s what her father was most able to do, put an end to everything.</p> <p>Whether they spent their day in the garden or at the sea, the point always came when a storm bird would call, or a cloud would cross the sun, and Alice&#x2019;s mother would shake herself awake, as if she&#x2019;d been sleepwalking through a dream. She became animated, turning on her heel to sprint towards the house, calling over her shoulder at Alice, <em>first one to the kitchen gets fresh cream on her scones.</em> Afternoon tea was a bittersweet time; her father would be home soon. Ten minutes before he was due, her mother would position herself by the front door, her face pulled too tight in a smile, her voice pitched too high, her fingers in knots.</p> <p>Some days Alice&#x2019;s mother disappeared from her body altogether. There were no stories or walks to the sea. There was no talking with flowers. Her mother would stay in bed with the curtains drawn against the blanching light, vanished, as if her soul had gone somewhere else entirely.</p> <p>When that happened, Alice tried to distract herself from the way the air in the house pressed on her body; the awful silence as if no one were home; the sight of her mother crumpled in bed. Those were things that made it difficult to breathe. Alice picked up books she&#x2019;d read a dozen times already and revisited school worksheets she&#x2019;d already completed. She fled to the sea to caw with the gulls and chase waves along shore. She ran alongside the walls of sugar cane, throwing her hair back and swaying like the green stalks in the hot wind. But no matter how she tried, nothing felt good. Alice wished on feathers and dandelions to be a bird and fly far away into the golden seam of the horizon, where the sea was sewn to the sky. Day after shadowy day passed without her mother. Alice paced the edges of her world. It was only a matter of time before she learned she could disappear too.</p></p><h2>Remodeling a Basement: Revised Edition (Taunton&#39;s Build Like a Pro)</h2><p><p><strong>If you're interested in expanding the usable living space in your home &#x2015;and boosting its value &#x2015; finishing your basement is a smart way to make it happen.</strong><br><br> In this new and revised edition of <strong><em>Remodeling a Basement</em></strong>, you'll find a wide range of inspiring design ideas for turning your basement into a comfortable, functional space the whole family can enjoy.<br><br> <strong>From cover to cover, you'll get all the expert advice, inside tips, and step-by-step instructions you'll need to make your vision a reality.</strong> All brought to you in clear, accessible language &#x2015; and lots of valuable photos and drawings &#x2015; by a consummate professional.<br><br> <strong>In this comprehensive volume&#x2015;the latest in our popular <em>Build Like A Pro</em> series &#x2015;professional contractor Roger German takes you through the entire process of remodeling a basement.</strong><br><br> From family rooms, bathrooms and laundry rooms to workshops and hobby rooms, he shows you how to build a whole new level of comfort into your house.<br><br> <strong>Here's an example of the timely, in-depth information you'll find:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Every construction detail is updated to reflect the latest building code</strong></li> <li><strong>All the basic construction techniques you'll need are here</strong></li> <li><strong>Nuts and bolts information about wiring, plumbing, windows and doors</strong></li> <li><strong>Brand new content about egress windows</strong></li> <li><strong>How to tackle common basement building challenges, like framing on concrete, evacuating water, and working around heating and plumbing fixtures</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>For proactive homeowners and contractors alike, this updated reference book is the only resource you'll need to get the job done right the first time.</strong></p></p><p>Roger German has been a builder and contractor for 30 years.

Williams has committed an act of love."&#x2014;Alice Walker<br><br>"A classic."&#x2014;Jack Kornfield<br><br>There truly is an art to being here in this world, and like any art, it can be mastered.&nbsp;<br><br></b>In this elegant, practical book, Angel Kyodo Williams combines the universal wisdom of Buddhism with an inspirational call for self-acceptance and community empowerment. Written by a woman who grew up facing the challenges that confront African-Americans every day, Being Black teaches us how a "warrior spirit" of truth and responsibility can be developed into the foundation for real happiness and personal transformation. With her eloquent, hip, and honest perspective, Williams&#x2014;a Zen priest, social activist, and entrepreneur&#x2014;shares personal stories, time-tested teachings, and simple guidelines that invite readers of all faiths to step into the freedom of a life lived with fearlessness and grace.</p><p>In this exquisite primer on Zen Buddhism, author and ordained Zen priest Angel Kyodo Williams is not trying to convert African Americans into a new religion. Instead, she is simply presenting Zen principles and practices that emphasize living a life of grace and self-acceptance. Having faced the daily challenges of growing up black in America, she is especially adept at showing how these Zen principles apply to the African American experience. "People of color are especially in need of new ways and new answers to the separation and fear we face each day," Kyodo Williams writes. "It wouldn't be a stretch to say that as black people, more than most groups in this country, we live our daily lives with the distinct taste of fear in our mouths.... While the principles offered here are not an antidote to the underlying reasons for our fears, they can give us a different way to approach them."<p> Kyodo Williams offers a savvy yet tender voice as she walks readers through the basic principles of Zen. It's hard to resist her invitation to take on the numerous sensible vows that lead to enlightenment, such as staying true to the warrior spirit while "committing ourselves to practicing good." The bottom line is that this is a book about claiming the strength, compassion, and integrity that dwell within everyone. And although it speaks to the particular needs and trials of the African American community, readers of all colors and walks of life will find this an irresistible invitation. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Angel Kyodo Williams is an ordained Zen priest and founder of the Urban Peace Project.

That's why, before committing to a particular business, they go to great lengths to develop as clear and detailed a picture as possible of that company's current financial standing--and generate an accurate projection of its future performance.<br>Likewise, as facilitators of mergers and acquisitions, investment bankers are tasked with finding answers to crucial questions such as, "How much is the company really worth? Is its stock overvalued or undervalued, and, if so, what is the most correct stock price?"<br>But when it comes right down to it, investment bankers aren't all that different from you or any investor looking to make money in the stock market.

Once again taking Walmart as the example, Pignataro clearly and methodically shows you how to use the three analytical methods used by Wall Street analysts to determine whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or valued appropriately: comparable company analysis, discounted cash flow analysis, and precedent transaction analysis.<br>As an added bonus, the <i>Financial Modeling and Valuation</i> companion website features a downloadable version of the Walmart model template, along with additional case studies, exercises, test questions, and a practice model and solution to let you test and fine-tune your analytical skills.<br>Schooling you in time-tested financial modeling and stock valuation techniques used by analysts at the world's top investment banks, <i>Financial Modeling and Valuation </i>will help you make smarter, more rational investment decisions.</p><h2>Off the Grid: Houses for Escape</h2><p><p><strong>The ultimate escapist collection of environmentally sustainable houses, cabins, and retreats, this book circles the globe to find the best eco-architecture in the most stunning and remote locations.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The imperative to reduce our carbon footprint and focus on renewable energy is having a profound impact on our daily lives and the way we think about living spaces.

This is why guys that read it don't read or recommend anything else. Because the few men who "get it" spend the rest of their lives enjoying sexy girls in abundance &#x2013; and so can you.<br><br> You can learn to get ANY girl you want, the same way that all men who are naturally good with women have. The only difference is that you may learn it much FASTER, instead of wasting tons of time and money on fruitless dates or a new car/haircut/shirt that you BELIEVE will make you more attractive &#x2013; but really doesn't.<br><br> You see; men LACK success with women because they either don't understand what women are attracted to, or because they THINK that they do know, but have the wrong ideas and hence waste a lot of time - sometimes their entire life - chasing things they don't need. You know you have to get this book if you believe women want men with money, cars, or anything else that is manmade, because that doesn't make any sense. If women really were attracted to something unnatural, how did men meet women before any of those things were invented?<br><br> The approach you'll learn in The Manual is very different from conventional dating and the advice you find in the mainstream media because it focuses on natural attraction &#x2013; on what women REALLY want &#x2013; not what they CLAIM they want or what males in general BELIEVE women want. It incorporate men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s socialization and explains phenomenas such as why men think women are attracted to things such as money (yet money is a man-made invention that has not even EXISTED very long) and why women &#x201c;play hard to get&#x201d; (a well-known phrase which amusingly reveals that women ARE easy but only pretend not to be).<br><br> This is why the beginning of the book addresses your basic beliefs and mindset, because if you learn to THINK correctly, you will automatically behave correctly around women. Even if they are so stunning they normally take your breath away, your mind goes blank, and you run out of words.<br><br> You already have what it takes to seduce women. Like, if you never run out of words around your close friends or family, you should be able to talk to a hot girl without making a fool out of yourself. The reason you seem to be a different person in such situations is because you ARE &#x2013; you are NOT being yourself! You act differently because you were socialized to sabotage yourself. The Manual teaches you how to unlock your true potential and to bring out the real you &#x2013; not change you into someone you are not.<br><br> The method presented to get girls works on all women, no matter what language they speak, how young they are, or what type of relationship you might be looking for. It's universal because it's based on natural attraction, what all women are hardwired to respond to, and attraction is an emotion, not a decision.<br><br> You can use it to get a sexy girlfriend, one night stands or even long-term relationships. You can use it to find true love, a soul mate, or just casual sex without commitment. And one of its best benefits is that it will make women want to be with you and appreciate you. The girls you get will REMAIN attractive even after you have formed a sexual relationship with them, because they are so happy to be with you. While most other guys who do get (average) girls, often find themselves with an average female who becomes even less attractive over time as she stops taking care of herself completely.<br><br> All other dating books simply repeat conventional wisdom that doesn't work very well in reality, and even the best ones are about ACTING like an attractive man, not on how to BECOME one. But the problem is if you go around acting like someone besides yourself, even if you do start getting girls, it's not really YOU who are getting them. The Manual will show you how to get laid like a rock star, without being one, and without pretending to be one either.</p><p></p><h2>Class Action</h2><p><b>One sixth grader takes his battle against homework all the way to the Supreme Court!&nbsp;</b><br><br> Sixth-grader Sam Warren is sick of stressing over assignments, and that's exactly what he tells his teacher: NO.

More than 30 years after he left Louisiana State University, his NCAA scoring record still stands. He enjoyed fame, wealth, and short of winning an NBA championship, achieved every possible success. But there was a price. Pete brought a childlike exuberance to the court that often masked a tortured and confused adult. Things changed dramatically and permanently, however, when Pete found Christ. At last he experienced peace and a purpose that extended beyond the basketball court. He became an avid student of the Bible and a tireless evangelist. Tragically, at age 40, Pete Maravich died. This is the first <i>authorized</i> biography.</p><p>The late Pete Maravich is a basketball legend. He averaged more than 44 points a game in his career at Louisiana State University&#x2014;before the advent of the three-point shot&#x2014;and 24 during his NBA career. But more than his scoring was his passing. He was inarguably the most spectacular, creative passer in the history of the game. Pete was the son of a successful coach, Press Maravich, and neighbors recall young Pete hanging out of a car window, dribbling, while his dad drove slowly around the side streets, gradually picking up speed. Federman and Terrill recount Maravich&#x2019;s playing career in entertaining fashion, though the sheer number of game accounts is numbing. As for the personal Pete, they come to many of the same conclusions as Mark Kriegel did in his masterful 2006 biography, Pistol&#x2014;that success on the basketball court did not translate to happiness. It was only after his career was over that he found contentment in Evangelical Christianity and working with kids. This isn&#x2019;t quite the polished piece of work that Kriegel&#x2019;s book is, but it offers an evenhanded treatment of all aspects of Maravich&#x2019;s life. --Wes Lukowsky</p><h2>Pok�mon Adventures: Black and White, Vol. 5 (5)</h2><p>All your favorite Pok�mon game characters jump out of the screen into the pages of this action-packed manga!<br><br> White tests out a Pok�mon battleground prototype: the Battle Subway.

In this award winning book, former Miss America, Marilyn Van Derbur, describes, in detail, her healing process after 13 years of incest. &#34;I wrote the book, not because I want someone to learn more about me but so readers can learn more about themselves. And so that loved ones can better understand the brutal recovery process and never again say, &#34;just get over it.&#34; The pain ends, I promise . . . IF you do the &#39;work&#39; of healing. A loving, long-term relationship and grounded well, adjusted children await you. A judge for the Writers Digest book competition wrote: &#34;Seldom as a judge have I wanted to read the entire book but I devoured every word of this riveting story... Told with stark honesty and vivid details that were so important in ridding herself of the pain, torment and shame...&#34; Anyone who knew Marilyn Van Derbur as a child and young adult believed she had it all -- a loving family, a beautiful home, an active social life. But beneath the surface, Van Derbur was a troubled young woman who lived through horrific panic attacks and excruciating physical pain every day of her adult life. Starting when she was just a child of five, she was sexually abused by her father until she turned 18. Van Derbur uses the term &#34;incested,&#34; eschewing the more vanilla terms of &#34;molestation&#34; or &#34;abuse.&#34; As a student and young adult, Van Derbur was an overachiever with an unconscious need to stay very busy. She realizes now this was a coping mechanism to keep her two worlds separated-the &#34;night child&#34; who suffered at the hands of her father and the &#34;day child&#34; who was happy and outgoing. After being named valedictorian of her high school class, she went on to college. Persuaded to enter a local beauty pageant, she ultimately was crowned Miss America. Ignoring the sheer terror she felt at the prospect of speaking in front of others, Van Derbur went on to become a highly successful motivational speaker. She writes of her endless need to be respected by others, all the while believing that if others really knew who she was, they would hate her and look at her with disdain and disgust. The perfectly poised mask she showed the outside world was a far cry from the tortured, panic-stricken, anxious woman within. The shame she felt within was a constant in her life, reminding her that she was &#34;unworthy.&#34; When a newspaper reporter learned of her story, Van Derbur&#39;s private shame became front-page news. Then she landed on the cover of People magazine. Soon incest survivors from around the country were reaching out to her, desperate to tell someone what had happened to them. It became instantly clear that her new role in life was to help others who had suffered incest and to help teach everyone how to make sure their children are safe from predators.</p><p>Anyone who knew Marilyn Van Derbur as a child and young adult believed she had it all -- a loving family, a beautiful home, an active social life.

But beneath the surface, she suffered from horrific panic attacks, unrelenting insomnia and excruciating body pain. No one could imagine that her father &#34;incested&#34; her from age five to 18.

While a sophomore in college, her sorority sisters nominated her for Miss University of Colorado. Three months later, she was crowned Miss America. Ignoring the sheer terror she felt at the prospect of speaking in front of others, Van Derbur chose motivational speaking as her career and, within a decade, she was named &#34;Outstanding Woman Speaker in America.&#34; Believing people would look at her with disgust and distain if they knew her secret, Van Derbur had an obsessive need to be successful and respected.

The facts about hormones . Why dieting can cause hormonal havoc . How hormones boost metabolic rate and fat burning . How inflammation causes obesity and hormonal imbalance . How to control appetite with the help of hormones . How hormones affect sexual appetite . The road to safe weight loss<br><br>For decades, an endless stream of well-marketed diets and newfangled exercise programs have been promising an easy path to a leaner, trimmer you. Every year, it seems, we are enticed to drop all "bad carbs" or to purchase the latest piece of home gym equipment and good health and happiness will surely be ours. But the rules of fat loss have changed from what we once thought them to be. No longer can we rely on diet alone to shed unwanted weight. Nor can we simply exercise the �ds away. Certainly, poor eating habits and lack of physical activity are two of the biggies when it comes to explaining escalating obesity rates. But they are by no means the only culprits.<br><br>Today's headlines read like a laundry list of previously overlooked factors that can impede successful weight loss--from lack of sleep and excess stress to the chemicals in our soaps. With so many lifestyle influences to consider, all the calorie-cutting and exercise in the world, in isolation, will not provide the golden key to achieving the lasting change we desire.<br><br>Until now, the prevailing approach to conquering obesity has been like putting a broken arm in a sling without first resetting the bone. Yes, weight loss happens when we burn more calories--via exercise and basic life functions such as breathing and digesting--than we take in. But there's another absolutely critical, routinely ignored variable that must be integrated into this equation: our hormones. These wondrous, unseen chemicals are produced by our bodies to manage everything from breathing to digestion to sexual responses and more. At the same time, our hormones are influenced by a myriad of factors, including exercise, diet, sleep, stress, and even the seemingly innocuous, everyday chemicals in cosmetics.<br><br>What Are Hormones?<br><br>What are you thinking right now? Do you feel happy or anxious? What did you eat for your last meal? Is it noisy where you are? How deeply or quickly are you breathing? Did you exercise today? How many cups of coffee have you had? Do you like the person beside you at the moment? Have you enjoyed sex lately?<br><br>The answer to every one of these questions has an impact on your hormones. As your five senses delicately interact with and respond to your environment, your nervous system is continuously communicating with your endocrine system--a series of glands and tissues constantly at work manufacturing, delivering, and processing a wide assortment of hormones to maintain body balance. Even the emotions you experience have the potential to influence your hormones--and vice versa.<br><br>Hormones are essentially tiny chemical messengers that spark communication processes throughout your body. They play an enormous role in influencing almost every aspect of your well-being, including your thoughts and feelings. Whether you feel the need to sleep, warm up, cool down, eat jelly beans, grab a coffee, or have a quickie, your desires and actions can be traced back to your hormonal activity.<br><br>Hormones also directly affect your appearance. Besides body composition, the look and feel of your skin and hair are influenced by hormones. If you want to look fresher, stimulate your metabolism, lose fat, feel calmer, sleep better, get stronger, feel sexier, and focus better, gaining control over your hormonal balance is truly the key.<br><br>Since hormones control our appetites and stimulate metabolism, achieving and maintaining hormonal balance plays an essential role in achieving lasting fat loss. Yes, diet and exercise are important, but so are sleeping well, reducing toxin exposure, maintaining healthy liver function, optimizing digestion, limiting stress, and conquering inflammation. All of these factors can influence our hormonal activity--and weight-loss success-- in truly dramatic ways.<br><br>Our hormones dictate where we store fat and how we will lose it. Research from the Journal of the American Medical Association (April 2007) suggests our hormones also determine our success with different diets. Dr. David Ludwig, director of the obesity program at Children's Hospital Boston, found that people who rapidly secreted large amounts of the hormone insulin in response to consumption of sugar or carbohydrates tended to achieve better weight-loss results on a low-glycemic diet that restricted starches and sugars than they did on a low-fat diet. He also discovered that they carried more weight around the waist (the so-called apple shape) compared with those who secreted less insulin and tended to store their excess fat around their hips (the pear shape).<br><br>THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM<br><br>While the nervous system coordinates rapid responses to outside stimuli, the endocrine system controls slower, longer-lasting responses to your environment. The link between these two systems is the hypothalamus, a small, almond-sized gland located in the brain.<br><br>Functioning as an endocrine gland, the hypothalamus secretes hormones that stimulate the pituitary gland to release other hormones into the bloodstream. The pituitary is often referred to as the "master gland," since its hormones act on the thyroid, ovaries, testes, and adrenal glands to regulate growth, reproduction, nutrient absorption, and metabolism.<br><br>Each of these glands responds to instructions from the pituitary and secretes hormones specific to its unique function in the body. The ovaries and testes, for instance, secrete the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. The adrenal glands release the stress hormone cortisol and antistress hormone DHEA. The thyroid releases thyroid hormones to manage your metabolic rate.<br><br>Many more hormones are produced without the direction of the pituitary gland by other tissues and glands of the endocrine system, including the pancreas, thymus gland, digestive tract, fat cells, adrenal glands, pineal gland, and the brain. Moreover, hormonal messages from other sources are relayed back to the hypothalamus to alter our behavior or actions. The hormone leptin is a good example of this type of hormonal control. This substance travels from fat cells through the bloodstream to the hypothalamus to regulate appetite.<br><br>Most bodily tissues are targets for one or more hormones released from the pituitary gland. According to Mary Dallman, a professor of physiology at the University of California who studies the effects of stress on appetite and obesity, two predominant endocrine hormones, cortisol and insulin, heavily influence caloric intake by acting on the brain. The stress hormone cortisol, in particular, activates a strong response in the brain to match our perceived stress with a desire to eat comfort foods--the tasty treats we associate with pleasant experiences, often from childhood. Unfortunately, consuming comfort foods, which are typically high in carbohydrates and fat, can cause a resulting spike in our insulin level, leading to the accumulation of belly fat.<br><br>Working together, the endocrine, nervous, and digestive systems can either help or hamper your weight-loss and wellness goals. Once you understand these complex systems and get them communicating optimally with one another, you will be well on your way to hormonal bliss and lifelong health.<br><br>The pear-shaped subjects fared equally well on both types of eating programs, but they tended to gain back over half the weight they lost on the low-fat diet after the study was completed. The apple-shaped people who followed the low-fat regimen also regained their weight, but kept it off after the low-glycemic diet.<br><br>Knowing your current hormonal state can help you select the eating plan that will work best for you. In Part Two, I'll tell you about a simple blood test that can provide you with not only a sense of your hormonal profile but also a strong indication of your potential for fat loss and aging well.<br><br>Hormonal Imbalance As a Cause of Obesity<br><br>The human body is a truly phenomenal machine that naturally strives to remain in a balanced state. When we're cold, we shiver. When we're thirsty or hungry, the brain gives us the appropriate signals to drink or grab a bite to eat. When our hormones and bodily responses are thrown out of balance, stress is the result. The body then miraculously offers a wide range of alerts, which can be as subtle as an increase in thirst or as severe as diabetes.<br><br>Consider these alarming statistics:<br><br>. An estimated 65 million Americans have metabolic syndrome, a set of underlying risk factors for type 2 diabetes and heart disease.<br><br>. By the age of 30, 1 in 4 people has an associated risk factor, such as abdominal fat or insulin resistance. . By the age of 60, 3 out of 4 people have one or more of the associated factors.<br><br>. One in 13 people suffers from hypothyroidism. Some sources say up to 30 percent of the population has a thyroid disorder and an estimated 13 million cases may remain undiagnosed each year. . Forty-three percent of women ages 18 to 59 report experiencing sexual dysfunctions at some point in their life. . About 75 percent of women experience premenstrual syndrome (PMS). . Seventy-five percent of menopausal women in North America experience life-disrupting symptoms. . Andropause, also known as male menopause, affects 30 to 40 percent of aging men. . An estimated 30 percent of men and 40 percent of women suffer from insomnia, a statistic that increases with age. . Seventy-four percent of adults are chronically sleep deprived. . The World Health Organization reports that by 2020 depression will become the number two cause of disability and premature death for men and women of all ages. . An estimated 80 to 90 percent of all disease is caused by stress.<br><br>What's the unifying factor among all these conditions? Every one of them is spurred by an underlying hormonal imbalance. Sadly, the signs and symptoms of hormonal imbalances are so widespread that they barely register as blips on our radar screens. Many of us have hormone-related health conditions that interfere with our quality of life, and we're not even aware of them. In fact, we're so imbalanced, I fear most of us don't even know what "normal" feels like anymore!<br><br>At the same time, we are in the midst of an obesity epidemic. More than 61 percent of Americans are overweight (BMI greater than 25), a number that continues to escalate each year. According to National Center for Health 2005/2006 statistics, more than 34 percent of Americans are obese (BMI greater than 30) compared to 32.7 percent who are overweight. Just under 6 percent are extremely obese. Data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) show obesity and related conditions alone account for more than $100 billion in health-care expenses annually in the United States.<br><br>Setting the Stage for Fat-Loss Success<br><br>What does hormonal havoc mean to you? Some women might immediately think of hot flashes or the emotional meltdown they experienced before their last period. Men might think back to what it was like being 17, when they could think of nothing but sex, sex, and more sex. Both these situations involve hormones that are out of whack, as do hypothyroidism, infertility, diabetes, stress, insomnia, depression, anxiety, obesity, irregular periods, low libido, memory loss, and a lengthy list of other conditions brought on by hormonal mix-ups.<br><br>But maybe you just feel tired all the time. Or you notice fat hanging around that seems impossible to lose. Perhaps your cravings for sweets, carbs, or salt will not let up, your skin is not as bright as it once was, or the texture of your hair has changed. These much subtler signs can also signal a state of hormonal upheaval.<br><br>When you complete your Hormonal Health Profile in the next chapter, you will see there are many symptoms of hormonal imbalance. No matter how an imbalance manifests on the outside, the internal reality remains the same-- any and all hormonal imbalance leads to difficulty losing weight, increased risk of obesity and unhealthy aging. Long-term weight loss and wellness are next to impossible until you bring your hormones back into balance.<br><br>The New Equation for Fat Loss:<br><br>Hormonal Balance + (Calories Taken in Calories Burned) - Lasting Fat Loss<br><br>Boost Metabolism with Help from Your Hormones<br><br>One of the primary factors determining body weight is metabolism, the internal furnace that regulates fat burning. Everyone's metabolism is different, which is why some people appear to be able to eat just about anything and remain lean while others seem to pack on �ds easily. But being overweight doesn't necessarily mean you have a slow metabolism, and there are five major factors that affect our metabolic rate.<br><br>1. THE THYROID: YOUR INTERNAL THERMOSTAT<br><br>The thyroid controls the metabolic rate of every single cell in the body and also maintains body temperature. Without enough thyroid hormone, all our bodily functions slow down. We feel tired and lethargic, gain weight, experience constipation, feel cold, and are prone to depression.<br><br>2. THE RUSH OF ADRENALINE<br><br>A quick release of adrenaline is the body's first response to stress. This hormone provides a short-term metabolic boost because it draws on the body's fat stores to provide that burst of energy we feel in a "fight-or- flight" situation.<br><br>3. MARVELOUS MUSCLE<br><br>Muscle tissue is metabolically active at rest, as well as during use. So the more muscle you have, the more calories you'll burn, even while sleeping or watching TV. This metabolic factor is the easiest to control with the right wellness plan. Unfortunately, loss of muscle is a normal part of aging. My three-step plan in Part Two of this book shows you how to slow this process and maximize muscle growth, even as you age.<br><br>4. THE THERMIC EFFECT OF EATING<br><br>Thermic pertains to heat. Thermic or "thermogenic" foods literally heat you up and raise your metabolism. The thermic effect happens as your body burns calories, simply by digesting and absorbing the food. Yes, even the very act of eating stimulates your metabolism, especially when you consume protein, which has the highest thermic effect of any food group. There's another metabolic benefit of protein: Eating it also helps to support metabolically active muscle growth, especially if you are practicing strength training. And strength training helps to increase the thermic effect! A study published in the Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise Journal found the thermic effect of the same meal was 50 percent greater in men who engaged in regular weight training versus those who were sedentary. This certainly helps to illustrate why strength training is so important for optimal calorie burning.<br><br>5. YOUR LOVELY LIVER</p><h2>The Book of Pitch Exploration: Can Your Voice Do This?

Today, <i>Personal Knowledge</i> remains one of the most significant philosophy of science books of the twentieth century, bringing the crucial concepts of &#x201c;tacit knowledge&#x201d; and &#x201c;personal knowledge&#x201d; to the forefront of inquiry.<br> <br> In this remarkable treatise, Polanyi attests that our personal experiences and ways of sharing knowledge have a profound effect on scientific discovery. He argues against the idea of the wholly dispassionate researcher, pointing out that even in the strictest of sciences, <i>knowing</i> is still an art, and that personal commitment and passion are logically necessary parts of research. In our technological age where fact is split from value and science from humanity, Polanyi&#x2019;s work continues to advocate for the innate curiosity and scientific leaps of faith that drive our most dazzling ingenuity.<br> <br> For this expanded edition, Polyani scholar Mary Jo Nye set the philosopher-scientist&#x2019;s work into contemporary context, offering fresh insights and providing a helpful guide to critical terms in the work.

In fact, <i>Personal Knowledge</i> represents a compelling critique of the positivist claim for total objectivity in scientific knowledge. . . .

Granted, &#x201c;helping&#x201d; may be too generous&nbsp;a word to use when talking about an animal known to sleep up to&nbsp;twenty hours a day. When they are awake, cats tend to keep to their&nbsp;own schedule and rituals, relying on humans for food, water, and clean&nbsp;litter boxes while doling out warmth and affection at their own whimsy.<br><br>When pawing through the Help Wanted ads, cats could find a number&nbsp;of job opportunities they might easily qualify for with little or no experience.&nbsp;There are shop cats who earn their keep curling up in chairs,&nbsp;sprawling on counters, and watching passersby from windows at a wide&nbsp;variety of business establishments, including dry cleaners, real estate&nbsp;offices, florists, and liquor stores. Bookstore cats have a pretty nice life,&nbsp;sleeping among the stacks or curling up in a beam of sunlight in the&nbsp;window display, greeting customers in exchange for a quick scratch or&nbsp;extended petting session. Scrappy bodega cats, the feline denizens of&nbsp;urban corner groceries and convenience stores, have become increasingly&nbsp;well-known&nbsp;in recent years, primarily thanks to social media; their&nbsp;country cousins, pastoral barn cats, have been climbing rafters, mingling&nbsp;with chickens, and napping upon stacks of hay for generations.&nbsp;And then there is the major subcategory of spirited cats, the bar cat, a&nbsp;storied tradition in pubs across the United Kingdom.<br><br>While having a charming cat lazing about keeping the shopkeeper company&nbsp;and casually greeting patrons is reason enough to employ one,&nbsp;the historic origin of the feline workforce is primarily in pest control.&nbsp;Dr. Fiona Marshall, a professor of archeology at Washington University&nbsp;in St. Louis, Missouri, wrote a study on the historical domestication of&nbsp;cats and in a 2013 interview with Audie Cornish on NPR&#x2019;s <i>All Things&nbsp;Considered</i> notes that while dogs were drawn to humans by the scraps&nbsp;of food they were offered and by the sight of humans hunting, cats,&nbsp;on the other hand, were interested in the by-product&nbsp;of what farmers&nbsp;were growing&#x2014;the&nbsp;rodents eating the grain.<br><br>Enter the distillery cat. (To clarify, I&#x2019;m using <i>distillery cat</i> as an umbrella&nbsp;term that covers brewery cats as well as winery and vineyard cats&#x2014;the cats that protect our spirits at the source.) For distillers and brewers,&nbsp;wheat, barley, rye, and corn are expensive cash crops, vital to&nbsp;the production of their spirits. For a mouse, rat, or bird, a distillery or&nbsp;brewery may as well be a twenty-four-hour&nbsp;all-you-can-&nbsp;eat&nbsp;buffet. A&nbsp;distillery cat&#x2019;s primary qualifications are to be friendly yet possess the&nbsp;instincts of a cold-blooded&nbsp;killer. In the ongoing battle between cat&nbsp;and mouse, mice are typically pretty quick on the uptake when a distillery&nbsp;cat comes on the scene. After seeing their brothers and sisters&nbsp;go missing in action, mice seek a new venue in which to pester and&nbsp;pilfer to avoid winding up on the hit list.<br><br>Historically, Ireland and Scotland have a keen tradition of keeping distillery&nbsp;cats on the payroll and are home to some of the most legendary&nbsp;mousers. A long-haired&nbsp;tortoiseshell dubbed Towser the Mouser lived&nbsp;her twenty-four&nbsp;years at the Glenturret Distillery, Scotland&#x2019;s oldest&nbsp;working distillery, where she ended her career with an estimated kill&nbsp;list of 28,899 mice, giving her the honor of being the <i>Guinness Book&nbsp;of World Records</i> &#x201c;World Mousing Champion.&#x201d; The staff at Dublin&#x2019;s&nbsp;Jameson Distillery was so enamored of their distillery cat, Smitty, that&nbsp;they had him stuffed after his death. He&#x2019;s still on display, positioned&nbsp;atop the rafters of the barley room, posthumously greeting visitors&nbsp;and serving as a deterrent to the local mouse population.<br><br>In America, as the boom in craft distilleries and breweries continues&nbsp;to spread across the country, there&#x2019;s a new breed of distillery cats&nbsp;stepping into the spotlight. While these first-generation&nbsp;mousers are&nbsp;delivering on their primal instinct and keeping their homes free of&nbsp;mice, they&#x2019;re also earning their bones in the age of Instagram. These&nbsp;unofficial mascots have become full-fledged&nbsp;brand ambassadors&nbsp;and social-media&nbsp;stars, with many possessing their own dedicated&nbsp;accounts and cat handlers. Their workdays are chronicled online, and&nbsp;taking a selfie with the house distillery cat has become as much a&nbsp;part of the tour experience as free samples of booze. While they still&nbsp;maintain their fiercely independent nature, when they&#x2019;re not sleeping,&nbsp;hunting, or supervising the staff, the modern distillery cat spends a&nbsp;good chunk of the day mingling with patrons in the tasting room.<br><br>While the cats are beloved by most, the looming concern over just&nbsp;how sanitary it is to have them on premises at a distillery or brewery&nbsp;does come up. Some cats have been vetted and approved by the local&nbsp;authorities from the county health department, while others have&nbsp;to keep out of the production facility and stay in the front office. I<br> didn&#x2019;t want to rat out any under-the-radar&nbsp;distillery cats, but when&nbsp;I asked distilleries and breweries about this and if there were any particular&nbsp;state laws on the subject, the replies were an equal amount of&nbsp;shrugs, pleading the Fifth, and a repeated refrain of &#x201c;don&#x2019;t ask, don&#x2019;t&nbsp;tell,&#x201d; although distilleries and breweries that offer food were quick&nbsp;to point out that the cat isn&#x2019;t allowed in the food production area.&nbsp;At most distilleries and breweries, the grain is stored in heavy sacks&nbsp;(which the cat can protect and sleep on, but not eat), and the rest&nbsp;of production&#x2014;including&nbsp;the grain crusher, kettle, and fermenter&#x2014;is&nbsp;part of a closed system to maintain a sterile environment.<br><br>As an animal lover and longtime cat enthusiast, I will always look the&nbsp;other way in regard to anti-feline ordinances and immediately grab&nbsp;my phone to take a photo when I see a cat hanging out atop a bar or&nbsp;sprawled across a pile of oranges at my local bodega, and the same&nbsp;goes for distilleries. I started the @DistilleryCats Instagram account to&nbsp;chronicle and celebrate the spirited tradition of working cats at distilleries,&nbsp;breweries, wineries, bars, pubs, caf�s, and liquor stores. In&nbsp;these pages, you&#x2019;ll read the stories, exploits, and adventures of some&nbsp;of the breakout stars of the new pedigree of American cats embracing&nbsp;their role as guardians of the grain and accidental Internet stars. All&nbsp;cats in the book represent first-generation&nbsp;distillery cats, and nearly&nbsp;all were adopted, rescued from a shelter, abandonment, or life on the&nbsp;streets. The &#x201c;adopt-don&#x2019;t-shop&#x201d;&nbsp;ethos supporting animal shelters is&nbsp;strong in this community, and there are amazing groups across the&nbsp;country with a mission to match up members of feral cat colonies&nbsp;with appropriate workplaces like distilleries and breweries as well as&nbsp;warehouses and farms. Hearing about these cats&#x2019; Dickensian pasts&nbsp;and seeing so many get a second chance at life&#x2014;and&nbsp;to be loved with&nbsp;abandon&#x2014;is&nbsp;the most meaningful part of the distillery-cat&nbsp;experience&nbsp;for me. Watching them develop into superstars with their own dedicated&nbsp;fan base is just a perk. Plus, what&#x2019;s not to love about the combination&nbsp;of cats and booze? Let&#x2019;s raise a glass of the good stuff (and&nbsp;pour out a saucer of milk) to distillery cats everywhere.</p><h2>Chords &amp; Scales for Guitar (Fast Track Music Instruction)</h2><p>(Fast Track Music Instruction).

Iceland is also home to an utterly unique and captivating food scene, characterized by its distinctive indigenous ingredients, traditional farmers and artisanal producers, and wildly creative chefs and restaurants.&nbsp;<br><br>Perhaps no Icelandic restaurant is as well-loved and critically lauded as chef Gunnar G�slason&#x2019;s Restaurant Dill, which opened in Reykjav�k&#x2019;s historic Nordic House in 2009. <i>North </i>is G�slason&#x2019;s wonderfully personal debut: equal parts recipe book and culinary odyssey, it offers an unparalleled look into a star chef&#x2019;s creative process.

His contemporary cooking celebrating Iceland's pristine ingredients and artisanal producers has garnered international acclaim and media. Dill has been nominated for the Nordic Prize and has earned numerous accolades including Iceland's restaurant of the year. In his spare time, Gislason can be found foraging with his children for ingredients to stock his restaurant's pantry, or salmon fishing in one of Iceland's glacial rivers. <br><br>JODY EDDY is the author of&nbsp;<i>Come In, We're Closed</i>, which profiled the staff meals of 25 of the world's best restaurants.

She first visited Dill in 2009 and has been a devoted disciple of Gislason's cooking philosophy ever since.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>In 2009, Iceland was in the middle of what would prove to be, relative to its size, the largest universal banking collapse experienced by any country in economic history. The ongoing financial implosion sent the nation&#x2019;s restaurants into a tailspin, as the cost of food skyrocketed and people could no longer afford the luxury of eating out. It is hard to imagine a more dismal time to open a restaurant, but Gunnar Karl G�slason had no alternative.<br><br> Just prior to the crisis, Gunnar, who had introduced contemporary Nordic cuisine to his country, had left his position as executive chef of Vox, Iceland&#x2019;s most esteemed restaurant, determined to realize his lifelong dream of opening his own place. Despite the financial maelstrom engulfing his nation, he decided to move forward on this idea. He chose the name Dill for the restaurant, to honor one of the nation&#x2019;s most abundant herbs and to highlight the foraging principle integral to his cooking philosophy.<br><br> As the economy blazed a downward trajectory fierce enough to disrupt financial markets around the world, every one of Gunnar&#x2019;s investors pulled out of the plan to open Dill in Reykjav�k&#x2019;s landmark Nordic House, designed by the famed Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. The building, the city&#x2019;s primary meeting place for cultural exchanges among the Nordic countries, seemed an ideal location for a restaurant celebrating the foods and cooking techniques of the region.<br><br> When the funding disappeared, Gunnar was forced to forge ahead with his plan with nothing but a resolute commitment to realize his dream and credit cards that &#x201c;burned red&#x201d; by the time he was finished. Since those dark days, Dill has become Iceland&#x2019;s most celebrated restaurant. But there is more to the story of its success than indefatigable work and enormous credit card debt. There is a promise made. And a promise kept.<br><br> The purveyors promised to supply the Dill kitchen with either free or heavily discounted products until Gunnar found his footing and could afford to pay them back. In most parts of the world, this arrangement would be unprecedented. In Iceland, it is a way of life. Icelanders know a thing or two about transcending struggle. This innate knowledge, born of an ancient and perpetual negotiation with the environment for survival, inspires an invincible kinship among the citizenry. That affinity expresses itself in a fidelity resolute enough not only to withstand the near collapse of an economy but also to open a restaurant with little more than a dream and a promise.<br><br> After months of working twenty hours a day, seven days a week, Gunnar&#x2019;s vision was realized, and his restaurant honoring Iceland&#x2019;s culinary heritage by showcasing its pristine products on a contemporary canvas quickly earned unparalleled success. It garnered acclaim around the world, becoming the must-visit restaurant for Icelandic tourists, a destination restaurant for culinary adventure seekers, and, most important for Icelanders, an establishment that finally put their nation on the international gastronomic map.<br><br> As successful as Dill became, Gunnar never forgot the debt he owed to his purveyors. He expressed his gratitude first through the repayment of his monetary obligations and then through a renewed commitment to protect the venerable culinary traditions of Iceland by showcasing local products on his restaurant menu in fresh, innovative ways. His approach is never to mask the integrity of the ingredients but rather to allow them to tell their own story. In doing so, they link diners to the past while simultaneously propelling them into the future&#x2014;the essence of contemporary Nordic cooking.<br><br> This cooking model has been embraced not only in kitchens in Iceland and its neighboring countries but also by chefs around the world who want to fortify their cooking with something more elusive than flavor. They are striving to stake a claim to important roles in society as architects, ambassadors, and educators of a revolutionized food system, one that values sustainability over industrialization, products with an historical pedigree over factory-produced foods without lineage. For Gunnar, a chef who has always been ardently committed to his producers, the <i>terroir</i> of his nation, and the traditions of the past, this role is nothing new. It is as instinctive to him as plucking sea urchins from a cold, frothy sea; harvesting seaweed the color of iron from a black stone beach in the shadow of a glacier; or gathering sorrel and angelica from craggy volcanic crevasses to supplement a restaurant menu that celebrates the local resources of a place that has been dubbed the world&#x2019;s only sustainable nation.<br><br> Striking a covenant with the environment that you will never take more than you need and that you will fight to protect it as long as it provides you with the seafood, game, livestock, and produce necessary to survive is a way of life in Iceland. It was practiced long before the words <i>foraging</i>, <i>terroir</i>, and <i>sustainability</i> became commonplace. This simple cooking philosophy was employed by Gunnar years before new Nordic cuisine and The Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen (see page 259) came to be among the culinary world&#x2019;s hottest buzzwords.<br><br> This book celebrates the cuisine and nation of a forward-thinking chef and the producers who supply his restaurant. The alchemy of the relationship between chef and producers, and between that pairing and the environment, is revealed in Gunnar&#x2019;s contemporary recipes, which are approachable enough for the home cook, yet sufficiently challenging to entice the professional chef. Each recipe tells a story, contextualizing and integrating the tenets of the contemporary Nordic kitchen into the ongoing larger conversation in the culinary community, and by extension the world.<br><br> The principles of this modern Nordic culinary philosophy can be put to work anywhere on the planet. That fact prompts some questions: If any professional or home cook can celebrate regionality in his or her cooking repertoire, why is there such an intense focus on the Nordic countries leading the way? Why have the nations that hover so close to the Arctic Circle garnered such prodigious praise in recent years? Why are expectations running so high for the Nordic pioneers of the culinary world? It is because they are at the forefront of a revolution in our food system constructed on an ideology that embraces a respect for place as the foundation of their cooking style. It is a revolution that is not defined by innovation as much as it is by centuries-old principles.<br><br> This cookbook adds a unique voice to this conversation by examining the culinary narrative of Iceland, a fascinating nation with a compelling gastronomic heritage that until now has gone virtually unexplored. It opens the doors to an extraordinary country whose identity is shaped in equal measure by a rich, harrowing past and a bright future. Iceland&#x2019;s citizens have endured a perpetual struggle to survive ever since their Viking ancestors settled the country in the ninth century, yet have now arrived at a moment when they are always ranked near or at the top of a United Nations&#x2013;compiled Gini index measuring such factors as life expectancy, educational attainment, literacy, and general standard of living. Iceland is one of the most egalitarian countries on the planet, and modern Icelanders are content despite the sometimes difficult circumstances they endure. This cookbook illuminates the continuity of past, present, and future, through Gunnar&#x2019;s contemporary recipes and through conversations with some of Iceland&#x2019;s traditional food purveyors. Together, they are preserving their nation&#x2019;s culture through the enduring language of food.<br><br> When I first visited Iceland in 2009&#x2014;before most cooks in the United States had heard of the new Nordic cuisine&#x2014;I returned extolling its virtues to my friends in the culinary industry. I declared that this new philosophy, with its focus on sustainable cooking practices, foraging, and <i>terroir</i>, would soon be embraced by chefs around the world. My enthusiasm was met with skepticism.<br><br> I returned to Iceland several times over the next few years to examine further what I knew was an extraordinary region on the verge of claiming the spotlight in the culinary world. I was fortunate to meet Gunnar Karl G�slason during my first visit, and he became my culinary mentor on subsequent visits to the country. Walking with Gunnar through the country&#x2019;s breathtaking terrain proved to be part history lesson and part culinary tourism, and always a feast. To join him as he forages&#x2014;not because it is trendy, but because it is inextricably woven into who he is as a chef and as an Icelander&#x2014;is to become privy to wisdom acquired throughout a lifetime of living close to the land.<br><br> Several years ago, only one airline flew nonstop from the United States to Iceland. Then, in 2011 alone, four new airlines established routes between cities in the United States and Reykjav�k. As travelers discover that Iceland is not only an incredible place to visit for the adventure seeker but also a top-notch culinary destination (not to mention that it is only a five-hour plane ride from New York City), it will grow into a travel and culinary hot spot.<br> Today, no one chastises me for my obsession with Iceland and its exceptional cuisine. Now I frequently hear from people asking for help planning a trip there. I always send them to Dill, where they are treated to the extraordinary cuisine and uncompromising hospitality of Gunnar and his staff. The reports on their return are unequivocally positive. They are usually followed by a request for a recipe or two from Gunnar and an outline of additional places to visit on their return trip, for it seems once you&#x2019;ve visited Iceland, you can never get enough.<br><br> From his earliest days working with farmers in the distant corners of Iceland until now, in his role as the country&#x2019;s best-known contemporary chef, Gunnar has listened closely to the landscape of his country and the stories of its producers. These voices have found their way into his refined cuisine, celebrated in a restaurant that is more than a dining establishment. Dill is a reflection of Gunnar&#x2019;s philosophy of an allegiance to the artisans, food purveyors, and citizens of Iceland.<br><br> The restaurant&#x2019;s service ware is designed by local artisans, its furniture is by Alvar Aalto, and the artwork on the walls is a regularly rotating display of local talent. The refined space of muted colors, clean lines, and an absence of clutter reflects the Nordic aesthetic of less is more. Spanning one entire wall is a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking a bird sanctuary, abundant with the herb bushes and raised gardens from which Gunnar forages daily. A greenhouse glistens for the part of the year in which the sun never sets and sparkles in starlight during the months of long, cold nights. Iceland is situated on the Gulf Stream, making its climate more temperate than most would imagine. Even on an afternoon in the middle of winter, Dill&#x2019;s guests wander along the edge of the lake outside the restaurant, past the vast garden beds awaiting spring planting.<br><br> As idyllic as Gunnar&#x2019;s visits to his producers are, an underlying urgency accompanies these encounters&#x2014;an urgency born of the need to preserve the traditional foodways of the country. The ingredients Gunnar serves at Dill reflect his devotion to ancient Icelandic traditions disappearing at a speed so alarming that he fears many of them will be gone within a generation. Because this urgency grows more acute with each passing day, this cookbook is both a recipe collection and a documentation of a way of life that is fast losing ground to the contemporary world.<br><br> If the next generation continues to eschew these traditional food craft jobs in favor of urban living, there may be nothing left to document in a decade or two. To combat that trend, this book is intended not only to remind Icelanders of their fascinating past but also to provide them with a road map for how to integrate tradition into their modern lives. And it is a powerful source of inspiration for others seeking to preserve the legacies established by generations of cooks, producers, and farmers in their corner of the world.<br><br>------------------------------------------------<br><br>Bacalao Potatoes <br> with fennel Ribbons and Sorrel Ash<br> Serves 4&nbsp; |&nbsp; Preparation time: about 1 hour (plus 24 hours to rehydrate the cod)<br><br> On a visit to northern Iceland, Gunnar and I stayed in an inviting apartment on the outskirts of Akureyri, the second largest town in the country (at a whopping eighteen thousand inhabitants) and Gunnar&#x2019;s birthplace. The only thing our cozy abode lacked was blackout curtains. Not surprisingly, the blinding July sun that drenches the country in light twenty-four hours a day results in severe sleep deprivation for anyone not accustomed to it. Gunnar, of course, is accustomed to his nation&#x2019;s days of perpetual light and slept soundly each night. Perhaps because he was not bleary-eyed by dinnertime (and because he is a naturally hospitable fellow), he took charge of the evening meal.<br><br> One of the first things he made was this creamy potato recipe incorporating Elvar&#x2019;s bacalao. It was not his intention to prepare it every night, but we couldn&#x2019;t seem to get enough of its comforting virtue. The bacalao infused it with just the right amount of brininess, and the pungent horseradish perked up any sleepy brains. It&#x2019;s hearty enough to work as a main dish and also makes a fantastic side. One night, Gunnar served it on toast; on another, he substituted smoked haddock, an ideal replacement for the cod. The profusion of herbs he added was dictated by whatever we foraged that day. This dish, which is inspired by a popular lunch item at Dill, is festively attired with fennel ribbons, a soft-boiled egg, and sorrel ash&#x2014;the latter a mainstay of the Nordic kitchen.<br><br>Potatoes<br> 1 pound (450 g) salted cod<br> 1 pound (450 g) waxy potatoes<br> 1/4 cup (60 ml) heavy cream, warmed<br><br>Sorrel Ash<br> Leaves from 1 bunch sorrel<br><br>To Serve<br> 4 carrots, peeled, cut into bite-size pieces, and roasted<br> 2 fennel stalks, cut into long ribbons using a vegetable peeler (see note)<br> 4 eggs, soft boiled<br> Freshly grated horseradish, for finishing<br> To make the potatoes, immerse the salted cod in cold water to cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, changing the water several times to remove as much salt as possible.

When his existing homilies were exhausted, Knox began to write new ones for his students based on the Apostles&#x2019; Creed. The homilies were so well-received that they were later published as <em>The Creed in Slow Motion.</em><br><br>With resurgent interest in the life and writings of Knox, as well as the changes to the English translation of the Creed, the new edition of this classic could not be more timely.

He was ordained an Anglican priest in 1912 and was made chaplain of Trinity College, Oxford. In 1917 Knox converted to Catholicism, a decision heavily influenced by his close friendship with G. K.

Abandoned early by her parents and expelled from her abusive grandfather&#x2019;s home when she was fourteen and pregnant, she lived in the woods before hitchhiking her way to Florida. In 1986, Wuornos began a relationship with Tyria Moore and supported them both through prostitution and theft. In 1986 she served a thirteen-month sentence for armed robbery. In 1989 she first shot and killed a john who picked her up hitchhiking. She later stated that she acted in self-defense, but the john&#x2019;s history as a violent sex offender was not allowed into evidence at her trial. Wuornos went on to shoot and kill at least six men between 1989 and 1990 and was arrested in 1991, then tried, convicted and sentenced to death. On the advice of a lawyer, she pled no contest&#x201d; for five other murders, receiving a total of six death sentences by February 1993. She was famously if inaccurately dubbed America&#x2019;s first female serial killer.&#x201d; While on death row, Wuornos was legally adopted by Arlene Pralle, a born-again Christian, in 1991, and was championed by many who believed her claims of self-defense. A documentary by Nick Broomfield, <i>Aileen: Portrait of a Serial Killer</i> (1992), portrayed Wuornos as a victim of both sexual abuse and media manipulation. As her execution neared, an increasingly unstable Wuornos retracted her self-defense claims, claiming she needed to go to her death with a clean conscience. Florida Governor Jeb Bush ordered a psychiatric exam, after which Wuornos was deemed mentally competent and executed by lethal injection on October 9, 2002. Thanks to the feature film <i>Monster</i> (2003), and the second Nick Broomfield documentary, <i>Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer</i> (2004), she has become even more famous after her death.<br><br><b>Phyllis Chesler, Ph.D</b> is an Emerita Professor of Psychology and Women's Studies at City University of New York.

These fathers are "silent, wounded warriors" who are suffering from fear, anxiety, anger, guilt, grief, and depression. Men who have lost a child to abortion often have an unexplainable need to defend their masculinity, causing confusion and strife in their relationships.<br><br>This study helps men acknowledge and face their inner turmoil. The authors walk hurting men through the stages of post-abortion stress, helping the move out of denial about the past and into acceptance and forgiveness. Men will learn about God's unchanging, loving character and his desire to forgive them and heal their father-hearts.<b>Linda Cochrane</b> is the executive director of Hopeline Women's Center in Monroe, Connecticut, and is cofounder of PACE (Post-Abortion Counseling and Education).

Perfect in their fusion of emotion and form, filled with drama and great beauty, they are among the best-known and best-loved works in all classical music. This volume contains complete scores for <i>Symphony No. 8 in F Major</i>, <i>Op. 93,</i> and <i>Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, Op. 125.<br></i>The eighth is full of beauty and innocent merriment, while the ninth is Beethoven's best and greatest symphony, a dazzling end to his symphonic works. Also included here is a translation of the passage from Schiller's ode "To Joy," featured in the last movement. Meticulously reproduced from the authoritative Litolff edition, each score features large, clear noteheads and wide margins for ease of use in studying and following the music. Far less expensive than comparable full-score editions, this volume belongs in the library of any music lover who wishes to study the masterly innovation and creativity Beethoven brought to the symphonic form.</p></p><p>The triumphant genius of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770&#x2013;1827) casts a long shadow over classical music &#x2014; no other composer of the past two centuries has exercised an influence more profound than his. A product of the classicist generation, he was the first of the Romantics, and his exhilarating works remain undiminished in their powers of enchantment.</p><h2>Parenting Your Kindergartner: A Guide to Making the Most of the &#34;Look at Me!&#34; Phase</h2><p><p><b>Parenting Your Kindergartner</b></p><b> </b><p><b>MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY PHASE IN YOUR CHILD'S LIFE</b></p> <p>You have approximately 936 weeks from the time your child is born until he or she graduates from high school.

Disorders (such as unhealthy growing conditions), pests, and diseases are all included here. You can treat all these problems by improving growing conditions, using biological controls, or applying safe, organic remedies.<br><br> We are botanists, plant pathologists, and writers. We&#x2019;ve owned nurseries and traveled the world on botanical adventures. In this book, we have compiled the most recent research to help you grow healthy cannabis. The United States government considers cannabis an illegal crop, resulting in no U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines, no Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, and virtually no university research on acceptable treatments for pests and diseases or on the efficacy of those treatments. Research on organic cultivation of cannabis is relatively limited. To find the best &nbsp;organic methods, we have worked with licensed legal growers who use organic practices and we have relied on research from European sources, the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI), and other scientific literature.<br><br> Every state in the United States that has legalized marijuana has its own statutes and guidelines. Be sure to find out what is permitted in your location, because we are not legal experts. Finally, we are not medical practitioners and have conducted no research on the medicinal attributes of marijuana. Please consult with your doctor or health care practitioner for advice on its medicinal uses.<br><br><b> WHY USE ORGANIC GROWING TECHNIQUES?</b><br><br> Whatever your intended use of cannabis&#x2014;whether as a medicine, relaxant, mood enhancer, ritualistic practice aid, or vehicle to alter perception&#x2014;you must inhale, ingest, or otherwise absorb its active&nbsp;ingredients. Any nonorganic, synthetic pesticide used on plants winds up inside you. Synthetic chemicals such as pesticides damage human health and the living community of which we are a part. Choose organic techniques to protect yourself and the environment.&nbsp;<br><br> No matter where cannabis is grown, virtually no health and safety standards exist for growing it. Because it is considered illegal in many places, research is lacking and testing is not standardized. Recent media coverage has revealed that pesticide residue on marijuana is an escalating problem. Labs that have performed tests have frequently found contaminants such as pesticides and heavy metals. These pesticides include fungicide and insecticide residues at levels sixteen-hundred times higher than the legal limit for food plants. This is alarming. It just makes sense to do everything possible to eliminate this threat to the health of cannabis growers, users, and the biosphere.</p><h2>Frida Kahlo: The Gis�le Freund Photographs</h2><p>In 1950, photographer Gis�le Freund embarked on a two-week trip to Mexico, but she wouldn&#x2019;t leave until two years later.

We&#x2019;re in the van already and it isn&#x2019;t even light outside. I begged them to change their minds, but they said Dad&#x2019;s new job is important to him and that families should support each other&#x2014;not make each other give up the things they love. I don&#x2019;t even think they&#x2019;re listening to themselves or they wouldn&#x2019;t have made me give up Florida. And you. I miss you already.<br> <br>Love,<br> <br>Tessa<br> <br>Rain batters the windshield of our ancient minivan, the wipers furiously working to keep the glass clear. City lights fade to a blur in my tired eyes. We left Fort Myers on Thursday morning. Nineteen hours in a seat belt, four Twinkies, twenty-one old episodes of The Simpsons, and one cramped hotel later we finally get here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Chicago. The Windy City.<br> <br>My parents keep saying this place is going to be everything we ever needed but didn&#x2019;t know existed. Whatever that means.<br> <br>&#x201c;Our house was built in the late eighteen hundreds, you know. So of course there will be some work to do,&#x201d; Dad says, loud enough so I can hear, but quiet enough not to wake my little brother, Jonah.<br> <br>Mom is nodding enthusiastically. &#x201c;I know. But it&#x2019;s so worth it. Think of all that original wood! And those high ceilings! It&#x2019;s a dream.&#x201d;<br> <br>I roll my eyes. It isn&#x2019;t a dream, but there&#x2019;s no telling them that.<br> <br>The car swerves violently around something in the road, and I crane my neck to see what it was. Shadows dance in the darkness stretched out in front of us. &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just a limb in the road. Everything&#x2019;s fine. We&#x2019;re alllllmost there,&#x201d; Dad says in that voice he uses when he&#x2019;s trying to lighten the mood. &#x201c;You okay back there, honey?&#x201d;<br> <br>I look up but can&#x2019;t see his expression in the rearview mirror. I&#x2019;m kinda glad. If I could see it, he&#x2019;d probably look wild and excited like he always does when he talks about moving here. About his new job.<br> <br>Given that I just left behind my best friend, Rachel, a seventh-grade year that was going to be amazing, and my favorite drawing class, I&#x2019;m not too interested in seeing that look right now.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Just a little nervous. We&#x2019;re going to get there okay, right?&#x201d; I ask as another small branch pings off our hood. Leaves are pinwheeling frantically through the air and landing on our windshield in a disgusting, wet mess.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course we are, Tess. This is just a fall thunderstorm,&#x201d; Dad answers, leaning forward even more. &#x201c;Nothing like hurricane season back in Florida. Remember all the times we almost evacuated?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod but stay silent. Truth is, we did almost evacuate a lot, but we never actually had to. It was warm there, too. Like the sun followed you around just to kiss the tops of your shoulders and lighten your hair. Based on the few times we&#x2019;ve visited here to house-hunt, I know it feels different. Colder.<br> <br>Mom reaches back, looking for me in the darkness. I grab her hand even though I still feel angry. Deep down I know it isn&#x2019;t her fault. It isn&#x2019;t anyone&#x2019;s. When the Chicago Symphony Orchestra comes calling with an opportunity, you answer. And my dad&#x2014;the best violinist in all of Florida&#x2014;was the guy they called to audition when the first chair opened up.<br> <br>I glance at Jonah, who is still sound asleep in his car seat. Both of his arms are wound tightly around Reno, the wooden ventriloquist dummy he refuses to go anywhere without. I hate the way Reno looks at me. Like he&#x2019;s watching me. Beady eyes, circus clothes, and a shock of black hair glued to wood&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ugh.<br> <br>Jonah settles deeper into his car seat and lets out a soft moan. I have no idea how he&#x2019;s sleeping through this disaster, but for a minute, I wish he weren&#x2019;t. Maybe if he started crying, Dad would stop the van. Maybe if he threw up, we could at least slow down a little. Maybe, maybe, maybe.<br> <br>Dad sighs. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s taken us an hour since we hit the city limits, but according to my GPS, the house is just around this corner. This looks familiar, right, Lily?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it obviously looks different in the dark, but I think so,&#x201d; Mom answers, a nervous laugh escaping her lips. Mom is the most positive person I know, but I think she&#x2019;s just as scared about this move as me. Maybe even more.<br> <br>I get it. I have no idea how she&#x2019;ll sell her paintings here or if she even can. There aren&#x2019;t any tiny seaside art shops or nautical boutiques here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I can&#x2019;t imagine people in Chicago paying big money for pictures of seagulls and turtles and waves.<br> <br>The car hugs the next curve as we turn slowly onto a narrow, one-way street. This is the right block. Small black wrought iron fences wrap around the trees. Parking signs jut up from the cement every few feet. A giant, metallic birdhouse-looking thingy sits on the corner. Mom says it&#x2019;s art, but I think it&#x2019;s horrible. Art is soft, and pastel, and shaded&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not metallic and sharp.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is the right place,&#x201d; I pipe up, unable to keep the disappointment from leaking into my voice. I remember this block well enough from the two times we came to see the house. Mom and Dad drooled over it. I smiled when I felt like crying because although my parents are excited, I know they feel guilty for dragging Jonah and me here. I can see it in the looks they give each other when they think I&#x2019;m not paying attention. I might miss Florida and all, but I don&#x2019;t want them to feel bad. Life happens, or so the bumper stickers say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Finally!&#x201d; Dad breathes out. He pulls the car onto the small patch of cement they keep calling a driveway and turns it off. The headlights stay on for a few seconds longer, fixed on the wooden garage door at the bottom of the slope. I remember hearing that it leads into a parking spot in the basement. A drive-in basement.<br> <br>So. Weird.<br> <br>Dad twists around in his seat and squares his body off between Mom and me so he can talk to both of us. &#x201c;Now remember, there&#x2019;s just the bare bones in here right now. A few things the previous owners left in here to make our transition easier until the moving vans arrive tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom raises an eyebrow. &#x201c;You mean, a few things that were too much of a hassle for them to move out. Right, Chris?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad tosses her a wink and a grin in response. I squint through the rain, wondering exactly what was left in this place. Hopefully nothing gross.<br> <br>Mom and I toss open our doors and make a run for it while Dad grabs Jonah from his car seat. I can hear my brother screeching from my spot on the front porch. The whole neighborhood probably thinks there&#x2019;s a wild animal on the loose.<br> <br>Reno&#x2019;s knobby wooden knees clank together as Dad jogs through the gauzy sheets of rain. He sets Jonah down on the top step, then rakes a hand through his dripping-wet hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he says, fishing in his pocket for something. Hopefully the keys because it&#x2019;s freezing out here.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Mom echoes, taking a tearstained Jonah by the hand. He&#x2019;s clutching Reno like a life preserver. &#x201c;This is it!&#x201d;<br> <br>Our new house is huge. Three floors and built like Fort Knox. Apparently Chicagoans call it a graystone, which is really just a fancy name for a cement house. I run a finger over the brick, shivering at how cold and unwavering it is.<br> <br>Back in Florida, nothing was brick. Nothing was really this gray, either. We had houses that were blue, green, and even yellow.<br> <br>I let my eyes settle on one of the second-floor windows. That room is mine. Mom picked it out during the house tour, started talking crazy fast about decorations and colors and how much I&#x2019;d love the view. All I saw then was an old room with warped wooden floors and cracked paint. All I see now is ugly gray brick and the dark, gaping eye of a window. It&#x2019;s watching me, this house. Waiting to swallow me whole in its cobwebby corners and creaky closets.</p><h2>Lioness: Golda Meir and the Nation of Israel</h2><p><b>Winner of the 2017&nbsp;National Jewish Book Award/Everett Family Foundation Book of the Year, this is the definitive biography of the iron-willed leader, chain-smoking political operative, and tea-and-cake serving grandmother who became the fourth prime minister of Israel.<br><br></b>Born in tsarist Russia in 1898. Golda Meir immigrated to America in 1906 and grew up in Milwaukee. where from the earliest years she displayed the political consciousness and organizational skills that would eventually catapult her into the inner circles of Israel's founding generation. Moving to mandatory Palestine in 1921 with her husband, the passionate socialist joined a kibbutz but soon left and was hired at a public works office by the man who would become the great love of her life. A series of public service jobs brought her to the attention of David Ben-Gurion, and her political career took off. Fund-raising in America in 1948, secretly meeting in Amman with King Abdullah right before Israel's declaration of independence, mobbed by thousands of Jews in a Moscow synagogue in 1948 as Israel's first representative to the USSR, serving as minister of labor and foreign minister in the 1950s and 1960s, Golda brought fiery&nbsp;oratory, plainspoken appeals, and shrewd-making to the cause to which she had dedicated her life&#x2014;the welfare and security of the State of Israel and its people.<br><br>As prime minister, Golda negotiated arms agreements with Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger and had dozens of clandestine meetings with Jordan's King Hussein in the unsuccessful pursuit of a land-for-peace agreement with Israel's neighbors. But her time in office ended in tragedy, when Israel was caught off guard by Egypt and Syria's surprise attack on Yom Kippur in 1973. Resigning in the war's aftermath, Golda spent her final years keeping a&nbsp;hand in national affairs and bemusedly enjoying international acclaim.<br><br>Francine Klagsbrun's superbly researched and masterly recounted story of Israel's founding mother gives is a Golda for the ages.</p><p><b>FRANCINE KLAGSBRUN</b> is the author of more than a dozen books, including <i>The Fourth Commandment: Remember the Sabbath Day </i>and<i> Married People: Staying Together in the Age of Divorce. Lioness&nbsp;</i>received the 2017 National Jewish Book Award/Everett Family Foundation Book of the Year. Klagsbrun was also the editor of the best-selling <i>Free to Be . . . You and Me</i> and is a regular columnist for <i>The Jewish Week,</i> a contributing editor to <i>Lilith,</i> and on the editorial board of <i>Hadassah</i> magazine. Her writing has also appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Newsweek, </i>and<i> Ms. Magazine.</i> She lives in New York City.The visit to America was a fantasy come true. Wherever Golda set foot, she was received with a bursting exuberance no Israeli premier before her had experienced. In Philadelphia, where she arrived on Sep�tember 24, 1969, a crowd of five thousand met her at the airport, many of them schoolchildren carrying posters that read, GOLDA A GO GO or WE DIG YOU, GOLDA. Afterward, more than twenty thousand people packed Independence Hall and applauded wildly at the end of her brief speech about Israel&#x2019;s desire for peace. &#x201c;I am wise enough to understand that the applause was not directed to me . . . It was rather an ovation for the State of Israel,&#x201d; she said, with required modesty. She knew as well as anyone that the men, women, and children who swarmed to see her in Philadelphia and every other city she visited were as intrigued by the &#x201c;71-year-old grandmother&#x201d; (as the press frequently referred to her) who headed the State of Israel as they were loyal to that state. Her simple bearing&#x2014;she appeared time and again in the same black-and-white her�ringbone tweed suit&#x2014;and midwestern twang with its faint echo of East�ern Europe made her seem the American dream come true, the local girl made good. The &#x201c;former Milwaukee schoolteacher&#x201d; (another favorite press nomenclature) from an impoverished family had risen against all odds&#x2014;including the odds of being a woman&#x2014;to the highest office in her land. Americans, and especially American Jews, who had admired her earlier as Israel&#x2019;s foreign minister, were swept away by her presence as prime minister. No one doubted that she would hold her own with the president of the most powerful nation on earth. &#x201c;What can you do? She&#x2019;s irresistible,&#x201d; one observer commented. Most people who saw and heard her agreed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Menahem, who was studying in America, came to Philadelphia with his family to meet his mother, as did her sister Clara, who still lived in Connecticut. They had all been invited to the state dinner President Richard Nixon was giving for Mrs. Meir in Washington the next night. On Thursday morning, September 25, a marine helicopter carried her and her party to the South Lawn of the White House, where the presi�dent greeted her before three hundred guests and the first lady handed her a bouquet of roses. She had been apprehensive about this meeting with a new president, Lou Kadar recalled. &#x201c;That changed the minute they met. She looked relieved and so did he.&#x201d; Often withdrawn and sus�picious, Nixon was all smiles as the two leaders mounted a red-carpeted platform for a brief exchange of greetings. Later he wrote that she &#x201c;con�veyed simultaneously the qualities of extreme toughness and extreme warmth.&#x201d; He responded to both, treating her with dignity but also with friendly ease.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her welcome had all the trappings of a grand occasion: a nineteen-gun salute on the White House lawn; the marine band playing &#x201c;Hatikvah&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner&#x201d; (in that order); and a ceremonial review of the troops, with Golda in her thick orthopedic shoes and car�rying her ever-present black handbag as she hurried to keep pace with the president and a bemedaled adjutant army general. At the gala dinner in her honor that evening, she wore a long coffee-colored lace and velvet gown and a strand of pearls, not nearly as chic as Mrs. Nixon in her pink velvet-trimmed dress designed by Geoffrey Beene, but more elegantly turned out than she had ever been. In his toast, the president spoke of the honor of receiving for the first time &#x201c;the head of government of another state who also is a woman&#x201d; and pulled out an &#x201c;old Jewish proverb&#x201d; that &#x201c;man was made out of the soft earth and woman was made out of a hard rib,&#x201d; a corny nod to her proverbial strength. He went on to compare her to the biblical Deborah, under whose leadership peace graced the land for forty years. At the much-coveted dinner, 129 guests dined on sole V�ronique and Chateaubriand, with a dessert of &#x201c;Charlotte Revivim,&#x201d; named for Sarah&#x2019;s kibbutz. Afterward, everyone attended a concert by Isaac Stern and Leonard Bernstein in the East Room, Golda hugging both of them when it ended.<br>&nbsp;<br>The real work of her American visit came in two meetings she had with the president. The Phantom jet fighters President Johnson had consented to sell Levi Eshkol had begun to arrive, but Israel needed more to counter the surface-to-air missiles and other arms the Sovi�ets were sending Egypt. She asked Nixon for an additional twenty-five Phantoms, eighty Skyhawk attack bombers, and low-interest loans of $200 million a year for periods of up to five years. She received &#x201c;no concrete, direct promise&#x201d; about those requests, she told a news conference, but she found that President Nixon had &#x201c;sensitivity&#x201d; toward Israel&#x2019;s problems and the balance of power in the Middle East, and she was satisfied with his assurances.<br>&nbsp;<br>She and Nixon discussed Israel&#x2019;s arms and economic needs in the Oval Office on September 25 and 26. Nixon would later recall his impres�sions of her at those talks. Indira Gandhi of India, he said, &#x201c;acted like a man, with the ruthlessness of a man, but wanted always to be treated like a woman.&#x201d; In contrast, Golda Meir &#x201c;acted like a man and wanted to be treated like a man,&#x201d; with no special concessions to her woman�hood, and he appreciated that. When their meeting began, she smiled for the photographers and made the proper conversation, but as soon as the press left the room, she &#x201c;crossed her leg, lit a cigarette, and said, &#x2018;Now, Mr. President, what are you going to do about those planes that we want and we need very much?&#x2019; &#x201d; From then on, they &#x201c;had a very good relationship.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Indicative of that relationship, they arranged a more direct way of staying in touch. Yitzhak Rabin, who had become Israel&#x2019;s ambassador to Washington a short time earlier, would communicate with Henry Kissinger, Nixon&#x2019;s national security adviser, and vice versa, bypassing both countries&#x2019; foreign policy departments. Minister of Foreign Affairs Abba Eban fumed at this arrangement, as had Golda when Ben-Gurion bypassed her to work with Shimon Peres. Happy with the president&#x2019;s wish for directness, however, she brushed aside Eban&#x2019;s unhappiness.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nobody but Golda and Nixon knew what transpired at their most private meeting, when they spent part of their time conversing on the White House lawn, where they could not be heard or recorded. &#x201c;As to the more substantive matters that I discussed with Mr. Nixon,&#x201d; she was to write in her memoir, &#x201c;I can only say that I would not quote him at the time, and I will not quote him now.&#x201d; They each claimed to have kept notes on their conversation; the president told Undersecretary Elliot Richardson that he had dictated a memorandum about the meeting. Apparently, neither that memorandum nor any other notes were sent to a state archive. They remain hidden or deeply classified. Yet based on memos from Kissinger and others speculating about the meeting, historians have concluded that the top secret subject the two discussed that fall day was Israel&#x2019;s nuclear capability. And through that discussion, they arrived at a historic turning point in America&#x2019;s attitude toward Israel and the bomb.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the early 1960s, after Israel had built its nuclear reactor in Dimona with the help of the French, Golda had pleaded with Ben-Gurion to &#x201c;tell the Americans the truth and explain why&#x201d; in regard to their nuclear pro�gram. Ben-Gurion dismissed such truth telling as naive and dangerous and then found himself hounded by President John F. Kennedy to allow American experts to inspect Dimona regularly. The pressure shifted to Levi Eshkol after Ben-Gurion resigned, and even though Lyndon John�son had less interest in the matter when he took office, the American vis�its continued, with Israel doing its best to hide every trace of its nuclear capacity. Eshkol was also pressed to join the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. All that changed after Golda&#x2019;s meeting with Nixon. In February 1970, Rabin informed Kissinger that Israel would not sign the Non-proliferation Treaty, and not long after that talk of American visits to Dimona ceased. Exactly what the two leaders said to each other at that mysterious meeting stayed secret, but Golda presumably acknowledged that Israel had the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Nixon seems to have accepted this fact on condition that Israel keep the program under wraps, carrying out no public tests and making no public state�ments about it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Whatever the precise terms of the Meir-Nixon agreement, from then on Israel maintained a policy of vagueness, <i>amimut, </i>or &#x201c;nuclear opacity,&#x201d; in the words of Avner Cohen, a leading expert on the subject, neither admitting to having the capability nor denying it. That policy has con�tinued to govern Israel&#x2019;s handling of the bomb and to shape America&#x2019;s acceptance of it as a reality in that country. Ironically, at a National Press Club appearance in Washington, a journalist asked Golda whether Israel would ever employ nuclear weapons if its survival were in jeopardy, to which she quipped, &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t done so badly with conventional weapons.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Their two days of meetings ended, Golda Meir and Richard Nixon spoke to the Washington press corps. They had no new decisions to announce, Nixon said, but they had made progress toward a better understanding of each other. Golda said she was going home with a lighter heart than she had coming. She had &#x201c;found in the President of the United States a friend of Israel&#x201d; with full understanding of the coun�try&#x2019;s &#x201c;problems and difficulties.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She did not go directly home. After two more days of meetings with various government officials, appearing on the prestigious television show <i>Meet the Press, </i>and visiting with Jewish community leaders, she headed to New York City and a whirlwind lovefest. A crowd of fifteen thousand turned out at City Hall Park, many arriving in chartered buses from New Jersey and Connecticut, to catch a glimpse of her. On Tues�day evening, September 30, Mayor John Lindsay hosted a black-tie dinner for her at the Brooklyn Museum (she wore the same gown as she had in Washington). With twelve hundred guests, several hundred more than had been invited for the shah of Iran, it was the largest and most expensive dinner the city had ever given. &#x201c;Sure, it&#x2019;s very high,&#x201d; the com�missioner of public events replied to criticism of its cost. &#x201c;But you had the head of Israel here and the expense of kosher cooking.&#x201d; (In contrast to the nonkosher presidential dinner at the White House.)<br>&nbsp;<br>During her three jam-packed days in New York, Golda attended a luncheon in her honor given by the UN&#x2019;s secretary-general, U Thant, hosted Governor Nelson Rockefeller at her Waldorf Astoria suite, con�ferred with Secretary of State William Rogers, appeared on the <i>Today </i>show, held private sessions with the editors of <i>Time </i>and <i>Life </i>and execu�tives of <i>The New York Times, </i>had breakfast with <i>Newsweek </i>editors, and lunched with broadcasting executives. When she appeared at a rally of almost four thousand Jewish high school and college students at Madison Square Garden, she received a ten-minute standing ovation. An overflow audience of two thousand massed outside to cheer her as she came and left. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s overwhelming,&#x201d; she said, beaming, of her New York reception. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s beyond anything I ever dreamed of.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And off she flew, in an El Al airplane, to a star-studded dinner in Los Angeles, where Governor Ronald Reagan shared the dais with her and the actor Gregory Peck asked her to dance. (She declined, regretfully.) Addressing the glittering audience, she told of how she had been kept so busy in New York that she did not have time to go to Macy&#x2019;s basement to buy pots and pans, the way she used to. They loved it. When she turned serious, she spoke of her willingness to travel anywhere to make peace with Arab leaders. The problem was that what the Arabs wanted &#x201c;could not be settled by compromise&#x2014;they want us dead. We have decided to stay alive.&#x201d; It was a line she repeated often, with variations, especially to the press.</p><h2>The Christmas Baby</h2><p>When a baby was born in the manger, Mary and Joseph rejoiced.

Quint Studer's new book is the study guide they need. Straight A Leadership, a book by Wall Street Journal bestselling author Quint Studer, can help your organization achieve the peak performance it needs to survive in the toughest environment. The book is based on Studer Group's work with hundreds of top healthcare organizations. It makes the case the vast majority of problems organizations face fall under one of the following three categories: Alignment - Think of C-suite leaders as aircraft pilots. If a pilot makes even a tiny error in setting longitude or latitude at the start of the flight, the plane can end up in the wrong city. Likewise, a small misalignment at the top echelon of a healthcare organization can spark problems that multiply as they cascade through the leadership hierarchy-causing everyone to veer off course. Action - Sometimes an organization is implementing the right action plan but it's being poorly executed. Other times, so many actions are taking place that they're working against each other, in the way that multiple medications can interfere with each other's effectiveness. Either way, the impact of each action is diminished or desired results go completely unmet. Accountability - An organization may be properly aligned and taking the right action steps, but without a good system of accountability in place, it will get only short term gains. The absence of accountability-for selecting the right talent, teaching the right tools and techniques, validating positive behaviors and evaluating overall performance-can derail long term results.

Quint was also placed in charge of focusing on employee satisfaction. From January 1993 to June of 1996, Quint served as COO of Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. His focus on patient care helped Holy Cross gain a national reputation in operational excellence by being named Hospital Magazines &#39;Great Comeback Winner&#39; in 1994. In June of 1996, Quint was named the Administrator of Baptist Hospital, Inc. in Pensacola, Florida. While President of Baptist Hospital, Quint used his past experiences to lead this organization to unprecedented success. In 1997, Baptist was named by Modern Healthcare magazine as their Service Excellence winner as well as being named by Voluntary Hospital Association as winner of their Leadership Award. In 1999, inc. (pronounced Ink) magazine named Quint its March Master of Business, making him the only healthcare leader to have ever won this award. Just recently, Quint received the honor of being named to Modern Healthcare&#39;s 100 Most Powerful People in Healthcare for 2008. In January 2000, Quint formed the Studer Group. Today the Studer Group is the leading company in assisting organizations to achieve their desired results. Along the way, Quint has written two (2) best selling books.

A. Jance</p><p>In the desert, a Native American woman is dead&#x2014;an ex-con once jailed for the murder of her husband&#x2014;and her teenage daughter has vanished into the long shadows of the night-still canyons. A dedicated law officer, Sheriff Joanna Brady of Cochise County has suffered stoically through loss and pain&#x2014;yet she has never wavered in her commitment to duty and the pursuit of justice. Now, as she stands on the brink of a new life and new happiness, death is summoning her once more, calling her down a twisted trail of hatred, greed, and devastating consequence to the black heart of the Dragoon Mountains.There is no respite yet for Joanna Brady&#x2014;only a terrifying excursion into a world of passion and violence, where long-buried secrets are the best reasons of all to kill . . . or to die.</p></p><p>A missing teenager and an octogenarian found dead of apparently natural causes are pretty run-of-the-mill cases in Bisbee, Arizona, where Sheriff Joanna Brady is focusing on the last-minute details of her upcoming wedding. In this latest outing in Judith Jance's Brady series, the connection between the two events is a thin one. In the author's capable hands, however, it's enough to drive this well-plotted mystery to a credible conclusion. <p> Fifteen-year-old Lucy Ridder dreads her mother's release from prison, eight years after she was convicted of killing Lucy's beloved father. Lucy is aware that her mother's priority is not a family reunion but the retrieval of a mysterious diskette entrusted to Lucy by her dad shortly before his death. After inadvertently witnessing her mother's brutal slaying by a stranger who's also hot after the diskette, Lucy vanishes. It takes most of the novel for Joanna to figure out that Lucy's disappearance is tied to her mother's murder, and for good reasons. Besides the distraction of her pending nuptials, the sheriff has been accused of killing her elderly, beloved neighbor for financial gain. Because the reader knows the truth of both situations very early in the game, Joanna's delayed awareness doesn't pack as much wallop as it might. The greater mystery is whether she'll strangle her wedding-obsessed mother before she and her too-good-to-be-true fianc� make it to the altar. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p>J. A.

In his early stand-up days, if he walked on stage and didn&#x2019;t like the crowd, he would walk off. Together with Jerry Seinfeld, he pitched NBC on a sitcom where nothing happens. A whole show could be about waiting in line at a Chinese restaurant. And somehow Seinfeld became the most successful comedy show of all time. After nine years of writing and producing Seinfeld, and after making a huge amount of money, Larry David began to create a new show for HBO. Without much separation between himself and the character he plays, Curb follows the daily routines of Larry David. Being politically correct is far from Larry&#x2019;s mind, and the audience cringes as he berates, torments, and blusters his way into the hearts of TV watchers. Follow the early exploits of Larry&#x2019;s stand-up career, his days writing for Seinfeld, and learn how Curb was conceived and developed. Pretty, Pretty, Pretty Good titled after Larry&#x2019;s key catchphrase also explores Larry&#x2019;s on- and off-screen relationships with famous pals like Richard Lewis, Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, and the cast of Seinfeld, and contains an in-depth episode guide to Curb Your Enthusiasm.</p></p><p><p>Josh Levine is the author of "Jerry Seinfeld: Much Ado About Nothing," and biographies of David E. Kelley and the Coen Brothers. He lives in Toronto, Ontario.<br></p><i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> is a show that divides people. There are those who love it, find it excruciatingly funny, and revel in its taboo&#x2013;breaking humor, in the aggressive outbursts of its characters, in its depiction of social, moral, physical, and sexual humiliations. They see Larry David as a Freudian id out of control, unable to conjure up the social restraints that stop the rest of us from saying what we really think and feel. And yet they appreciate that Larry, for all his selfishness, his childlike and neurotic behavior, is a man who enjoys and even embraces life.<p></p><p>These fans see the show as a step up from the more conventionally framed <i>Seinfeld</i>, with its traditional set, three&#x2013;camera shooting, punch lines, and laugh track. They consider <i>Curb</i> a far less comfortable show: darker, edgier, and more honest. They appreciate its use of improvisation and handheld camera work, the result of which is rougher and gives a more &#x201c;real&#x201d; feel to the show, despite the often&#x2013;complicated plotlines. They appreciate its fearless examination of cultural attitudes to religion, race, physical disabilities, and sex &#x2014; in a manner that, while highly politically incorrect, is in no way conservative or right&#x2013;wing. They see it as just as funny as <i>Seinfeld</i> but in a more painful way.</p><p>And then there are those who can&#x2019;t stand <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>, who have tried to watch it and find themselves unable to sit through its excruciating social embarrassments, its scenes of characters almost apoplectic with rage, saying things that should never be said, and its relentless references to sex acts, sex parts, rashes, bruises, injuries, urination, and defecation. What, they say, is enjoyable about any of that?</p><p>What&#x2019;s amazing is that the descriptions given by both sides are totally accurate. The show is all these things. And it is these things because of one man and his skewed, dark, hilarious, distressingly honest revelations of human behavior. Larry David.</p><p>As the co&#x2013;creator of <i>Seinfeld</i> and the author of nearly sixty of its scripts, Larry David was already one of the most successful television creator/writers of all time before <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>. His wealth has been estimated at somewhere in the vicinity of $300 million and even as you read this it is growing rapidly from <i>Seinfeld&#x2019;s</i> syndication rights. Now, as the creator, writer, and star of <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>&#x2014; a show with a large, cultlike following compared with the blockbuster <i>Seinfeld</i>&#x2014; he has become one of the most innovative artists of the small screen.</p><p>When someone is rich and famous it seems to the world to have been inevitable. But with Larry David, success was no sure thing. In his early forties, he was a little&#x2013;known, modestly successful comic, receiving muted responses from audiences and low pay for his gigs. He had a crummy apartment and sometimes made barely enough money for food. He had tried some television writing, making money for short periods, but had made no impression on the shows he worked for. He was frustrated and even angry, not only by the lack of success but by the lack of understanding and interest from the comedy&#x2013;club audiences. In fact, he didn&#x2019;t like the audience much, which may be why they, in turn, didn&#x2019;t like him.</p><p>Larry David looked, in fact, like he was headed for failure. But even so, he refused to compromise, to change his act or his comic approach in order to pander to an audience that he considered to have grown soft and complacent from watching <i>Tonight Show</i>&#x2013;style comics. He had a fresh, unusual view, not always a pleasant one, and though he was no intellectual (he didn&#x2019;t much like reading books) he had insights into ordinary, seemingly trivial aspects of human behavior that others had missed.</p><p>These innovations did not come from nowhere. They were rooted in his Brooklyn Jewish middle&#x2013;class upbringing. They were rooted most particularly in Jewish comedy, a humor descended from the Jewish tummler, the comic figure who would joke and ridicule and tease guests at traditional Jewish weddings back in the shtetls of Europe. It was a humor that found its way into American vaudeville and then into the mouths of the great Jewish comedians of the past (Groucho Marx, Jack Benny, Shelley Berman, Don Rickles, Lenny Bruce, Woody Allen), a dark comedy of cynicism, complaint, aggravation, aggression, humiliation, neediness, and restless energy &#x2014; an insider kind of humor that by some miracle became popular with the larger American audience.</p><p>When his mother would phone Larry to ask how he was doing, Larry wouldn&#x2019;t want to tell her the truth. &#x201c;Pretty, pretty, pretty good,&#x201d; he would say, each &#x201c;pretty&#x201d; qualifying the one before. It is very possible that Larry David could have continued to travel the small New York comedy&#x2013;club circuit, scraping by, becoming ever more disgusted and bitter. Or he might have finally quit, to take on the kind of low&#x2013;level job that he had worked in after college. But another comedian, an infinitely more successful one, as much a professional colleague as a friend, asked Larry for help. A television network had asked him to develop a show, and the comic, Jerry Seinfeld, had a hunch that Larry might be able to help him.</p><p>It was a good hunch.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Gestapo: The Myth and Reality of Hitler&#39;s Secret Police</h2><p>Written with access to previously unpublished records, this is the fullest and most definitive account available on Hitler&#x2019;s secret police, the Gestapo. The book illustrates how, despite its material constraints, this group was able to extend its reach widely and quickly by manipulating and colluding with the general public during World War II, making ordinary German citizens complicit in the rendition of their associates, friends, colleagues, and neighbors. Though it was a powerful institution, it was not an all-powerful institution, and McDonough also relates the fascinating and underreported accounts of a cross-section of ordinary and extraordinary people who opposed the Nazi regime and its oppressive governance.<br><br><i>The Gestapo</i> will provide a chilling new doorway into the everyday life of the Third Reich and give powerful testimony from the victims of Nazi terror, while also challenging popular myths about the Gestapo and its inner workings.</p><p><b>Professor Frank McDonough</b> is an internationally renowned expert on the Third Reich.

When Amelia Bedelia takes on a home renovation project, she adds her own funny touches, from sanding the deck with buckets of sand to pulling out the hammers to break ground!</p></p><p><p>Herman Parish was in the fourth grade when his aunt, Peggy Parish, wrote the first book about Amelia Bedelia. The author lives in Princeton, New Jersey.</p><p></p>Grade 1-3 Mrs. Hardy is expecting an addition and asks Amelia Bedelia to babysit for her children while she goes to the doctor. Then workers from a construction company stop to ask Amelia for directions and Amelia looks at the address, gets the numbers backward, and convinces the workers that they were sent to build an addition on the Hardy family's house. The literal woman and the children start to help the construction workers, and it's all downhill from there. The text is a bit wordy for beginning readers and the story line is somewhat confusing. A few of the terms may be a little difficult to grasp (such as the concept of a marble-top counter and a walk-in closet). The cartoon illustrations help clarify some of Amelia Bedelia's mix-ups, but others will need explanation. Still, fans of the series will enjoy this title.<i> Bobbee Pennington, Bryan Public Library, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To all of those dental patients whose whine rises in tandem with that of the drill, take note: You would do well to stifle your terror and instead offer thanks to Apollonia, the patron saint of toothache sufferers, that you face only fleeting discomfort rather than the disfiguring distress, or slow agonizing death oft meted out by dental-care providers of the past. The transition from yesterday's ignorance, misapprehension, and superstition to the enlightened and nerve-deadened protocols of today has been a long, slow, and very painful process.</p><p>For example, did you know that: <br>*Among the toothache remedies favored by Pierre Fauchard, the father of dentistry, was rinsing the mouth liberally with one's own urine.<br>*George Washington never had wooden teeth. However, his chronic dental problems may have impacted the outcome of the American Revolution. <br>*Soldiers in the Civil War needed at least two opposing front teeth to rip open powder envelopes. Some men called up for induction had their front teeth extracted to avoid service. <br>*Teeth were harvested from as many as fifty thousand corpses after the Battle of Waterloo, a huge crop later used for dentures and transplants that became known as "Waterloo Teeth."</p></p><p><p><b>James Wynbrandt</b> lives in New York City.</p>A breezy romp through the history of dentistry that will be excruciating only for those pained by word play, especially puns. Comedy writer Wynbrandt has fun with this one, but he has filled it with facts, too. He covers the world of tooth care from the Babylonians of 5000 b.c., worms and devils and treated them with henbane and prayer, to today's film stars with their dentist-crafted perfect smiles. Here one learns of the dental glory that was Rome (the first cavity is said to have been filled in the first century a.d.), the itinerant tooth-drawers of the Middle Ages and later eras. (``Not all tooth-drawers were crooks and deceivers. Some were merely incompetent.''), the beginnings of the modern dental era in 18th-century France, and the profession's 19th-century efforts to rid itself of quacks and charlatans (the world's first dental college opened in 1840). Wynbrandt wittily chronicles the development of anesthetics, fluoride, X-rays, drills, dental chairs, and even toothpicks. George Washington's famous false teeth are, of course, discussed; so is Ulysses S. Grant's dental work and George Custer's last toothbrush. Folklore, myth, religion, movies, poetry, and advertisements--all are tapped by Wynbrandt, who quotes liberally from a variety of contemporary sources to bring his light-hearted history to life. While sensitive dentists may wince at having their profession's rough-and-tumble past revealed, dental patients are more likely to feel relief at having been born in the modern era of dentistry. Both groups are in for a good laugh. (8 pages b&amp;w illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i></p><h2>Carving Patterns by Frank C.

Parents question whether nurturing their children's souls is even possible in the fast-paced materialistic culture in which we live. Utilizing the insight that springs from her knowledge of Torah wisdom, her personal experiences and the experiences of those she has counseled, Slovie Jungreis-Wolff, a longtime parenting coach and advisor to young couples and families teaches in detail how to approach the entire gamut of issues, with a special emphasis on strengthening the child's morality and character. Parents will learn how to:<br>� Instill <i>simchas hachayim</i>, "true joy," in their children<br>� Value <i>chessed</i>, kindness, in a self-absorbed world<br>� Create a <i>mikdash me'at</i>, a home filled with calm and reflection<br>� Teach children gratitude and appreciation<br>� And much more...<br>From discipline to sibling rivalry to effective communication skills, <i>Raising a Child with Soul</i> offers unique concepts and pragmatic ideas that can be understood and applied to both Jewish and non-Jewish households.</p></p><p>Slovie Jungreis-Wolff is a freelance writer and parenting instructor. She is the daughter of Esther Jungreis, renowned rebbitzen, author of <i>Life is a Test</i>, <i>The Committed Marriage</i>, and <i>The Committed Life</i> and founder of Hineni International. Slovie has taught Hineni Young Couples and Parenting classes at the Hineni Heritage Center in New York City for more than ten years.<p><strong>Chapter one</strong></p><p><strong>Raising Spiritual Children</strong></p><p>Igave birth to my son Eli on the holy day of Shabbos. Mendy and I couldn`t wait to share the excitement with our family. As soon as the Sabbath was over, my parents drove our children to the hospital to see their new baby brother. We marched to the nursery, looking anxiously through the glass window. Bassinets were lined up in even rows, filled with little blankets of pink and blue. The distinct cries of newborns permeated the air. Finally, we spotted our baby. His soft brown eyes were wide-open. My father`s face was aglow with joy. He turned to me and whispered, "This little soul has just arrived from heaven. Our sages teach us that in the heavens above he was learning Torah from the mouths of angels. He came into this world the purest of the pure. Watch over him, Slova Channahlah, and teach him well."</p><p>We are given these precious souls, and they are indeed a gift from Above. Parenting is not a simple road. There are many detours and challenges along the way. How do we know which direction to take? How do we know that the path we are leading them on is the best route available? What happens when we lose our way?</p><p>I have always been amazed at the amount of planning parents put into the minutest details of their babies` lives. Months before the baby is even born, the baby nurse, nursery colors, the brand of stroller, and even the preschool have all been discussed. As the child grows, so, too, does the List. Swim, karate, ballet, art, French, chess, and tennis lessons from the time they`re tots&#x2014;all ingredients that spell overload for both parents and children. We strive to give our children the best that we possibly can. We worry that they receive proper nutrition, cultural experiences, and an excellent education. What is most painful to me is the fact that rarely have I heard parents discussing their plan to develop their child`s soul.</p><p>We have become so consumed with thoughts of our child being in the right place, with the right crowd, in the right clothing, but what have we done to help this child become a spiritual being&#x2014;a person of substance and character? The problem becomes even more acute as our world becomes more obsessed with the pursuit of materialism. When was the last time you heard parents discussing their hopes for their child`s moral development? I am afraid that more time is spent researching the type of car we buy than the type of child we hope to raise. We must ask ourselves which qualities we desire for our children. What kind of character traits do we wish to imbue in them?</p><p>Each week women are given the unique opportunity to pray for their children. As Jewish women all over the world kindle their Shabbos lights, they utter a plea that has been passed down from mother to daughter for thousands of years. Growing up, I watched my mother encircle the flames with her hands, cover her eyes, and whisper her prayer through her tears. Today, my children observe me each Friday night as I do the same.</p><p>I believe that this Sabbath prayer gives us the direction we need when raising our children. We ask G-d: "privilege me to raise children and grandchildren who are wise and understanding, who love G-d, children of truth, holy offspring... who illuminate the world with Torah and good deeds."</p><p>I kindle my Sabbath lights and beseech G-d to help me raise children who will contribute goodness to mankind, children who are blessed with kindness, honesty, compassion, love of G-d, and spirituality. I ask that my children discover courage and inner strength in a world that has been overwhelmed with fear and terror. I want so much more than merely polite children&#x2014;manners is not a complicated subject. I pray for children who will possess a moral compass pointing them in the right path no matter how difficult the situation. In Yiddish, we call such an individual a <em>mensch</em>.</p><p>It is true that there are numerous books written by psychologists and psychiatrists on the subject of child-rearing. The problem is just that&#x2014;an overabundance of books! Every few years new theories and ideas are introduced. We are told to discard the old techniques and try the latest new-and-improved approach. What is a parent to do? The beauty behind the Torah path to raising children is the fact that Torah is immutable. It is a constant, neverchanging, eternal truth.</p><p>The holy Torah was given to the Jewish people by G-d thousands of years ago. We study that very same Torah today. If you open your heart to its wisdom, you will find solutions for every situation you encounter, a way to approach and live your life. Since family is the center of Jewish life, the Torah is a virtual storehouse of information and knowledge concerning the creation of our home.</p><p>Decorating an apartment or renovating a house is easy. It is a far more arduous task to transform that house into a home, a haven of spiritual comfort and serenity. I have visited some incredibly beautiful homes. There were magnificent marble floors, lavish powder rooms, endless arrays of bedrooms, and toys enough for an entire kindergarten. As soon as I entered, though, I felt something was missing. A vital ingredient was absent. I realized that it was a sense of peace acquired by living with a spiritual connection that was absent. We try to provide physical and emotional security, but what about our children`s spiritual security?</p><p>BRINGING SPIRITUALITY HOME</p><p>In Judaism we are taught that the key to our survival is the strength of our home. The Torah commands us: <em>Veasu li mikdash veshachanti besocham</em>. "They shall make a Sanctuary for Me so that I may dwell among them." Our sages teach us that these words include the understanding that if we build a home enveloped in sanctity, then G-d promises His presence within. We call this unique home a <em>mikdash me`at</em>&#x2014;a sanctuary in miniature.</p><p>Understand that this is not about creating a physical place of worship. You don`t need to build a temple or set up an ark in your living room to discover holiness within your life. It is, instead, a spiritual outlook that encompasses your home and that you take with you wherever you go. The Torah is giving us a personal invitation to embrace holiness in our daily moments of living. It is the way you speak, the way you conduct yourself, the way you relate to your spouse and children as you build your life together. Your entire perception is transformed as sanctity accompanies you throughout your days. It remains embedded deep within your soul.</p><p>Children who grow up in a home where the presence of G-d is consistently acknowledged are spiritual children. These families experience genuine warmth and blessing. They develop an awareness of G-d that provides comfort and fortitude even in the face of life`s travails and difficulties. There is no life that is completely shielded from problems and pain. Yet, a child raised in a <em>mikdash me`at</em> sees all of life`s challenges through a spiritual eye.</p><p>My family suffered a tremendous blow when my father was diagnosed with cancer. I vividly recall the moment when I heard the news. I had just finished teaching a class at the Hineni Center. As I was walking down the hall, I met my mother climbing up the stairwell. A single tear was rolling down her cheek. Her face was ashen. "What, Ema, what is it?" I asked, my heart pounding. When she told me of the doctors` diagnosis, I felt as if I would crumble. My father was ill? Impossible! Throughout his entire life, I had seen him only full of life and laughter. His six-foot-two frame and broad shoulders easily carried the weight of the world. There was no burden too heavy for him to bear. Whether it was his family or his congregation, his strong yet kindly presence was a constant reminder of his personal faith and courage.

Some of them like to say that the goddess Ani wrote the Great Book and made it so that ten men and women who loved stories would find copies of it at the same time. Some of them say a mere woman with ten children transcribed Ani&#x2019;s words over ten years. Others say some illiterate half-witted farmer wrote it in one night after Ani blessed him. Most believe that the Great Book&#x2019;s author was a mad yet holy, always always holy, prophet who&#x2019;d taken refuge in a cave.</p><p>What <i>I</i> can tell you is that two hundred years after it all went wrong an old man named Sunuteel was out in the desert. This man was one of those who enjoyed being out there for weeks on end, close to the sun, sand, and desert creatures. The time away from his wife made their time together sweeter. Sunuteel and his wife agreed on this. They were old. They had wisdom.</p><p>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; his wife said with a smile. She took his old rough hand into her equally rough old hand. She was a beautiful woman, and Sunuteel found it easy to look into her eyes. &#x201c;It is good,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I need the solitude.&#x201d;</p><p>There had been an especially powerful Ungwa storm and the old nomadic couple had barely survived the dry thundery night of lightning. A bolt had struck near their sturdy tent, setting on fire one of the three stunted palm trees they&#x2019;d camped beside. His wife had been peeking out of the tent when it happened. Thankfully, she&#x2019;d blinked at precisely the right moment. She said the tree looked like a woman dancing in flames. Even as Sunuteel dragged her to the center of the tent where they huddled and prayed, his wife felt a presence. She was sure it was a premonition.</p><p>The old man was used to his superstitious wife and her odd intuitions. Therefore, he knew his wife would want to be alone to think and ponder and fret. When the storm passed and she gently encouraged him to take a few days to go and see what was out there, he didn&#x2019;t argue. He took the rolled up goatskin tent and satchel of supplies she handed him and kissed her on the cheek. He didn&#x2019;t say goodbye because in his tribe &#x201c;goodbyes&#x201d; were a curse.</p><p>&#x201c;I leave my <i>chi</i> to keep you company,&#x201d; he said. Each night he was away, along with her meals, she&#x2019;d prepare a small plate of food for his personal god until Sunuteel returned. He clipped his portable to his hip, facing the tiny device inside his pocket. After one last, far more prolonged kiss, he walked away from his wife. Did she think an angel was coming to visit her? His wife&#x2019;s descendants were from the Islamic portion of Old Naija. She said that her father used to tell her all sorts of stories about angels and djinn. She&#x2019;d passed these magical stories on to their own children as they grew up.</p><p>Minutes after leaving, Sunuteel brought out his portable and laughing to himself, called up the virtual screen and typed, &#x201c;Hussaina, greet <i>her</i> for me when you see her, whether she&#x2019;s an angel or djinni.&#x201d; Moments later, his wife Hussaina&#x2019;s reply popped up on the screen saying what she always said when Sunuteel went off, &#x201c;And you make sure you bring me back a good story.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Two days later, Sunuteel came upon a cave full of computers. A tomb of old old technology from the Black Days, the Times of the Dark People, the Era of the Okeke. This was one of those caves into which panicked Okeke packed thousands of computers just before Ani turned her attention back to the earth. These computers were supposedly used to store huge amounts of information separate from digital repositories called virtual spaces. Little good this did; virtual or physical, it was all dead, forgotten, rotten.</p><p>&#x201c;What am I seeing?&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Can this be?&#x201d;</p><p>He pressed a shaky hand to his chest, feeling the strong heartbeat of his strong heart. Standing here, he didn&#x2019;t feel so old. No, not old at all. This place made him feel young as a babe. Sunuteel, who was Okeke and therefore a descendant of the evil that caused the goddess Ani to bring the deserts, knew of the poisonous Black Days and their most poisonous genius gadgetry. However, he had always wanted to see these ancient computers with his own eyes.</p><p>So, he went in.</p><p>The cave was cool and it smelled of dust, mineral oil, plastic, wires, and metal. There were ghosts here and Sunuteel shivered from the thought of them. Still, he approached these old machines. <i>This</i> was a story to tell his wife. The third computer that he touched sparked with life. Terrified, he snatched his hand from the &#x201c;on&#x201d; pad he&#x2019;d accidently brushed against and stumbled back. The grey hand-sized box, softly hummed. Then it spoke to the portable clipped inside the pocket of his dusty pants. The portable pinged softly as it wirelessly received a large file from the computer. Sunuteel blinked and then fled from the cave, sure a ghost had touched him.</p><p>When he made it back to his small goatskin tent beside a baobab tree, only then did he dare look at his portable. He held the coin-sized device in his palm and brought it to his face, for his eyesight was poor. He squinted at the tiny screen. Next to the file that contained messages from his wife was a black icon in the shape of a bird that seemed to be looking over its shoulder. He tapped it with the tip of his finger and a deep male voice began to speak in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. English!</p><p>It was an audio file. Sunuteel sat back in his tent, grinning with delight. <i>My goodness</i>, he thought. <i>How strange. What are the chances?! </i>He <i>knew </i>this dead language, albeit the accent was very odd, indeed. He brought up the virtual screen. The visual words that appeared as the audio file played were tinted red instead of the usual green. He put the portable on the blanket before him. Then he watched and listened.</p><p>The voice read a table of contents as it digitally projected the words on the virtual screen in front of him:</p><p>&#x201c;Section one, mythology. Section two, legend. Section three, mechanics. Section four, news&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>He frowned as it read on and on. After a while, he decided to click on &#x201c;Section thirty-eight, memory extracts&#x201d; because the phrase rung a distant bell from when he was a child. In school, the teacher had spoken about the dark times hundreds of years ago, when human beings were obsessed with the pursuit of immortality. They had even found a way to pull out and capture people&#x2019;s memories right from their minds so they could preserve them forever. &#x201c;Just like a capture station sucking condensation from the sky to make drinking water,&#x201d; his schoolteacher had said.</p><p>Sunuteel had been fascinated and quietly proud of just how <i>far</i> human beings had gotten in their technological pursuit. Nevertheless, his schoolteacher had discouraged him from further research. &#x201c;Sunuteel,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This was what led us to receiving Ani&#x2019;s wrath.&#x201d;</p><p>And so the young Sunuteel turned away from the past and looked mostly toward the future. He loved language, words and stories. He&#x2019;d gone on to become one of his village&#x2019;s most valued recorders and reciters. He could recite the most beautiful poetry in five different dialects of flawless Okeke, but also in the language and various dialects of the majestic and mighty Nuru people and the common language of Sipo. And most amazingly, one of the prominent village elders had been able to teach him English, too.</p><p>As far as Sunuteel knew, this elder, an old-timer in Sunuteel&#x2019;s village who&#x2019;d always been called The Seed, was the only person who knew the language. The Seed was also the only light-skinned person in his village who was not albino. This man refused to call himself Nuru, insisting that he was &#x201c;Arab,&#x201d; a term that had long become more an insult than an ethnic description of the Nuru people. The Seed preferred to live amongst the Okeke, the dark-skinned woolly-haired people. He&#x2019;d built a house in front of one of the pyramids because it reminded him of home. When Sunuteel was a teen, The Seed looked no older than fifty, but Sunuteel&#x2019;s mother said he was actually much older.</p><p>&#x201c;He looked the exact same when I was a little girl,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told him. She was right. Even now that Sunuteel was an old old man, The Seed still looked no older than fifty. Sunuteel was of a people who understood that the world was full of mystery. Thus, a seemingly immortal man living in the village didn&#x2019;t bother anyone. The Seed had an amazing command of the English language and though he was moody and reclusive at times, he turned out to be a wonderful teacher.</p><p>Sunuteel went on to read the only two English texts in the entire region, both of which were owned by the Seed. One was an anthropology book titled <i>Virulent</i> <i>Diseases of the Mars Colonies</i>, the other a book about igneous rock sediments. Despite the dryness of the subjects, Sunuteel loved the rhythm of English. It was a liquid sounding language, due to the way the words ran together.</p><p>&#x201c;Memory Extracts,&#x201d; the voice announced in English. But then it began speaking another list and each item on it was in a different language, none of which he understood. Annoyed, Sunuteel listened for a while and was about to go back to the main menu when the male voice clearly said, &#x201c;Extract number 5, <i>The Book of Phoenix</i>&#x201d; in English.</p><p>He clicked on it.</p><p>At first there was a long pause and the bird icon popped on the screen. It rotated counter-clockwise. He counted thirteen rotations and when it kept going, he looked up at the sky. Blue. Clear. A large hawk-like bird flew overhead, soaring high in the sky, probably seeing him perfectly with its sharp eyes. <i>I will return to Hussaina in two days</i>, he thought. <i>That&#x2019;s enough alone time for her to stop thinking about premonitions and angels</i>. He smiled to himself. She would excitedly cook him a spicy meal of doro wat when he told her he had &#x201c;a big big tale to tell.&#x201d; She loved a good story, and good stories were best told on a full stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;Memory Extract Number 5,&#x201d; the male voice suddenly announced, making Sunuteel jump. &#x201c;Title: <i>The Book of Phoenix</i>. Location Number 578.&#x201d;</p><p>And then a woman began feverishly speaking. Her soft breathy voice was like a powerful incantation, for as she spoke, it seemed that the old man&#x2019;s eyesight, which dimmed more and more every year, began to brighten. His wife would have recognized what was happening. However, Sunuteel was a man less open to such things.</p><p>Still, as he sat in his tent, gazing through the red virtual words before him and the open tent flap just beyond the words, outside into the desert, he realized he could see for miles and miles. Sweat prickled on his forehead and between the coarse hairs of his armpits. He listened. And the very first person to hear one of the many many entries from <i>The Great Book</i> was awed by the story he heard.</p><p><i>&#x201c;There is no book about me,&#x201d;</i> the voice said.<i> &#x201c;Well, not yet. No matter. I shall create it myself; it&#x2019;s better that way. To tell my tale, I will use the old African tools of story: Spoken words. They are worthier of my trust and they&#x2019;ll last longer. And during shadowy times, spoken words carry farther than words typed, imaged, or written. My beginnings were in the dark. We all dwelled in the dark, mad scientist and speciMen, alike. A dear friend of mine would say that this time was when &#x2018;the goddess Ani still slept&#x2019;. I call my story </i>The Book of Phoenix<i>. It is reliable and short, because it was accelerated&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br></i></p><p><b>CHAPTER 1<br>SpeciMen</b></p><p>I&#x2019;d never known any other place. The 28th floor of Tower 7 was my home. Yesterday, I realized it was a prison, too. I probably should have suspected something. The two-hundred-year-old marble skyscraper had many dark sides to its existence and I knew most of them. There were 39 floors, and on almost every one was an abomination. I was an abomination. I&#x2019;d read many books and this was clear to me. However, this building was still my home.</p><p><i>Home</i>: a. One&#x2019;s place of residence. Yes, it was my home.</p><p>They gave me all the 3D movies I could watch, but it was the plethora of books that did it for me. A year ago, they gave me an e-reader packed with 700,000 books of all kinds. No matter the topic, I consumed those books voraciously, working my way through over half of them. When it came to information, I was given access to anything I requested. That was part of their research. I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but I know it now.</p><p>Research. This was what all The Towers were about. There were seven, all in American cities, yet they were not part of the American government. Not technically. If you dug for information, you would not find one governmental connection on file.</p><p>I had access to information about all the towers, and I read extensively. However, Tower 7 was where I lived, so I studied this tower the most. They gave me many &#x201c;top-secret&#x201d; files on Tower 7. As I said, I was always given what I asked for; this was part of the research. But also, they did not see me as a threat, not to them. I was a perfectly contained classified &#x201c;speciMen.&#x201d; And for a speciMen, knowledge wasn&#x2019;t power.</p><p>Tower 7 was located in Times Square on the island of Manhattan, United States of America. Much of Manhattan was underwater, but geologists were sure this part of it was stable enough for Tower 7. It was in the perfect position for top surveillance and security. I&#x2019;d read about each floor and some of the types of abominations found on them. I&#x2019;d listened to audios of the spiritual tellings of long-dead African and Native American shamans, sorcerers and wizards. I&#x2019;d read the Tanakh, the Bible, and the Koran. I studied the Buddha and meditated until I saw Krishna. And I read countless books on the sciences of the world. Carrying all this in my head, I understood abomination. I understood the purpose of Tower 7. Until yesterday.</p><p>Each tower had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. specializations. In Tower 7, it was advanced and aggressive genetic manipulation and cloning. In Tower 7, people and creatures were invented, altered, or both. Some were deformed, some were mentally ill, some were just plain dangerous, and none were flawless. Yes, some of us were dangerous. I was dangerous.</p><p>Then there was the tower&#x2019;s lobby on the ground floor that projected a completely different picture. I&#x2019;d never been down there but my books described it as an earthly wonderland, full of creeping vines covering the walls and small trees growing from artistically crafted holes in the floor.

Opening with a discussion of the evolution of criminal investigation and the importance of forensic science, this text fully explores the investigative process, types of crimes, and the trial process.&nbsp;<br>Criminal Investigation differs from other texts on the subject in several highly important ways:�Presents criminal investigation as a science, rather than as an art, giving full importance to precision and rigorous methodology, setting it apart from and above other texts on the subject.�Places techniques into context by discussing typologies in depth, including offenses, offenders, and victims, enabling readers to take away a more comprehensive understanding of criminal investigation, while providing access to substantial reference information.�Includes crime-prevention sections that help crime scene investigators work with victims to avoid further loss.�Recognizes the uniformed officer's role in and contribution to the ultimate success of an investigation, separate from the role of the detective.<br>The authors Charles R. Swanson, Neil C. Chamelin, Leonard Territo, and Robert W. Taylor bring their vast range of experiences to the topic. Collectively, they have worked in municipal police departments and a sheriff's office; been consultants to local, state, federal, and foreign police agencies; held faculty appointments in criminal justice departments; taught in police academies; and served as expert witnesses. The authors have written multiple books and articles and have presented papers at national conferences. Criminal Investigation reflects what they have learned from their practical experiences, supplemented by the relevant research.<br>New to This Edition�Every chapter has been updated with the most current information.�A host of new photographs, figures, and tables have been added to reinforce and expand the text coverage.�Quick Fact boxes benefit students throughout the entire book.�Feature numbered boxes are included in most chapters to aid students and provide context.�A boxed feature highlights a new topic "Thinking Outside the Forensic Entomology."<br>For Connect users, the free ReadAnywhere downloadable app is available on iOS and Android mobile devices.

In doing so, he reveals that groups we think of as implacable enemies have, over the centuries, formed unlikely alliances, thereby disputing the idea that conflict in the Balkans is the ineluctable product of ancient grudges. And he exposes the often-catastrophic relationship between the Balkans and the rest of Europe, raising profound questions about recent Western intervention. Updated to cover the last decade&#39;s brutal conflicts in Kosovo and Macedonia, the surge of organised crime in the region, the rise of Turkey and the rocky road to EU membership, The Balkans remains the essential and peerless study of Europe&#39;s most complex and least understood region.</p><p></p><h2>Lord of the Flies - Large Print Edition</h2><p>This is a famous and popular novel that has been reprinted many times.

Former New York Times reporter and Chinese-American (or American-born Chinese). In her search, Jennifer 8 Lee traces the history of Chinese-American experience through the lens of the food. In a compelling blend of sociology and history, Jenny Lee exposes the indentured servitude Chinese restaurants expect from illegal immigrant chefs, investigates the relationship between Jews and Chinese food, and weaves a personal narrative about her own relationship with Chinese food. The Fortune Cookie Chronicles speaks to the immigrant experience as a whole, and the way it has shaped our country.</p><p>Jennifer 8. Lee, the daughter of Chinese immigrants and a fluent speaker of Mandarin Chinese herself, grew up eating her mother&#39;s authentic Chinese food in her family&#39;s New York City kitchen before graduating from Harvard in 1999 with a degree in Applied Mathematics and economics and studying at Beijing University. At the age of 24, she was hired by the New York Times, where she is a metro reporter and has written a variety of stories on culture, poverty, and technology.Adult/High School&#x2014;Lee takes readers on a delightful journey through the origins and mysteries of the popular, yet often overlooked, world of the American Chinese food industry. Crossing dozens of states and multiple countries, the author sought answers to the mysteries surrounding the shocking origins of the fortune cookie, the inventor of popular dishes such as chop suey and General Tso's chicken, and more. What she uncovers are the fascinating connections and historical details that give faces and names to the restaurants and products that have become part of a universal American experience. While searching for the "greatest Chinese restaurant," readers are taken on a culinary tour as Lee discovers the characteristics that define an exceptional and unique Chinese dining experience. Readers will learn about the cultural contributions and sacrifices made by the Chinese immigrants who comprise the labor force and infrastructure that supports Chinese restaurants all over the world.

Yet many of us know very little about a tragedy that may strike our own loved ones&#x2015;and much of what we think we know is wrong. This clear and powerful book dismantles myth after myth to bring compassionate and accurate understanding of a massive international killer.</p><p>Drawing on a fascinating array of clinical cases, media reports, literary works, and scientific studies, Thomas Joiner demolishes both moralistic and psychotherapeutic clich�s. He shows that suicide is not easy, cowardly, vengeful, or selfish. It is not a manifestation of "suppressed rage" or a side effect of medication. Threats of suicide, far from being idle, are often followed by serious attempts. People who are prevented once from killing themselves will not necessarily try again. </p><p>The risk for suicide, Joiner argues, is partly genetic and is influenced by often agonizing mental disorders. Vulnerability to suicide may be anticipated and treated. Most important, suicide can be prevented. </p><p>An eminent expert whose own father's death by suicide changed his life, Joiner is relentless in his pursuit of the truth about suicide and deeply sympathetic to such tragic waste of life and the pain it causes those left behind.</p></p><p>Thomas Joiner is Distinguished Research Professor and Bright-Burton Professor of Psychology at Florida State University.&#x201c;<i>Myths about Suicide</i> seeks to debunk the myriad ways that suicide is stigmatized by ignorance, disgust, contempt, and callousness.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter Monaghan</b><b>, </b><b><i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this very readable book, Joiner's wide ranging knowledge of the subject leads to deeply penetrating thoughts on the psychology of suicide. He attacks myths from multiple perspectives, drawing on materials from biblical times to the present, scientific research studies and clinical case studies, animal studies, literature, popular culture, and film. The book also advances Joiner's own theory of suicide: people who kill themselves feel that they are a burden to their socially significant others and feel alienated from society. Whether readers are beginning students or advanced researchers, they will find an abundance of stimulating thought and data here.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>W. Feigelman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;When people kill themselves and those left behind are interviewed, they often respond with timeworn phrases, understandably. But such cliches often only spread myths...Joiner doesn't discuss the morality of killing oneself, nor how suicide can sometimes be a reasonable option. Rather, he seeks to spread the truth about suicide while "leaving a healthy fear of it intact." In that way, many lives may be saved and much anguish averted. Joiner's theory is that people desire suicide when they simultaneously hold these two psychological states in their minds for long enough: the perception that one is a burden and the sense that one does not belong. Only a more widespread and accurate understanding of suicide, he insists, can help counteract such states and prevent unnecessary deaths.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Susan K.

But for many who come to treat their back gingerly because they fear further "injury," a cycle of worry and inactivity results; this aggravates existing muscle tightness and leads them to think of themselves as having a "bad back." Even worse is the understandable but usually counterproductive assumption that back pain is caused by "abnormalities"&#x2013;bulging disks, a damaged spine, and so on. However, these abnormalities are frequently found in those who have absolutely no pain whatsoever. In reality, most backs are strong and resilient, built to support our bodies for a lifetime; truly "bad backs" are rare.<br><br>Drawing on their work with patients and studies from major scientific journals and corporations, the authors <i>of</i> <i>Back</i> <i>Sense&#x2013;</i>all three are former chronic back pain sufferers themselves&#x2013;developed a revolutionary self-treatment approach targeting the true causes of chronic back pain. It is based on conclusive evidence proving that stress and inactivity are usually the prime offenders, and it allows patients to avoid the restrictions and expense of most other treatments. After showing readers how to rule out the possibility that a rare medical condition is the source of their problem, <i>Back</i> <i>Sense</i> clearly and convincingly explains the actual factors behind chronic back pain and systematically leads readers toward recapturing a life free of back pain.</p><p>About 50 million Americans suffer back pain every year, and chronic back pain disables 1 in 40 adults. <i>Back Sense</i> takes a different approach, contending that most chronic back pain is caused not by a damaged spine, but by stress, muscle tension, and inactivity. The aim is to help you reclaim your life and decrease your pain.<p> The spine might be damaged initially, but it usually heals on its own, the authors assert. After that, stress causes muscle tightness, which results in continued pain. Traditional treatments don't work because they treat the spine, not the stress. The solution: understand your own symptoms and pain, learn to resume full activity, and work with your negative emotions to prevent them from derailing your recuperation.</p><p> Part 1 of <i>Back Sense</i> helps you evaluate your own case and determine whether you have warning signs of a serious injury or disease (in which case you must get medical attention), understand the mind-body connection, and examine how stress may be causing your chronic pain. Part 2 teaches you how to bring full physical activity back into your life and manage your negative emotions.</p><p> The authors--two of whom relieved chronic back pain with this very program--do not want you to baby your body or limit your life to protect your back. Rather, they contend that "being careful actually appears to be harmful." They explain that "as long as you are trying to get rid of pain, you stay preoccupied with it," creating more tension, and by avoiding "risky" movements, you lose muscle conditioning, making you vulnerable to additional injury. The book takes you through a process of gradually incorporating more exercise and tracking your reactions.

This third and final installment about Maddie, Zoe, and Angela takes the girls in new directions, and, with Jana (the series' antagonist) back with a vengeance, they are struggling to retain their "bff" status. Rife with the daily drama of modern-day high school, the book's appeal is widespread. As before, the story is told through a series of instant-message and chat-room conversations and is written entirely in that "language," which also adds to its appeal.

It helps readers to effectively apply all three types of maps to make work visible at the organization, process, and job/performer levels.</p><p></p><h2>Math Mammoth Grade 7-A Worktext</h2><p><p><i>Math Mammoth Grade 7-A</i> is the student worktext for the first half of grade 7 mathematics studies, as part of <i>Math Mammoth Grade 7</i> curriculum.</p><p> Please note that this particular book is the version with grayscale (or black-and-white) interior pages.</p><p>The curriculum meets and exceeds the Common Core Standards (CCS) for grade 7. It exceeds it because we study linear equations in more depth than required in grade 7 CCS.</p><p>We start out with an introduction to basic algebra, which is in many ways a review of the same topics from 6th grade. The first chapter reviews the order of operations, the concepts of an expression and equation, and the distributive property. Students learn about the commutative and associative properties of addition and multiplication, and they simplify expressions that don't involve negative numbers.</p><p>In chapter 2, we study integers and their operations in detail. Again, some of this is review from 6th grade, and some of it is new. The four operations of integers are explained with the help of two visual models: the number-line and counters, hopefully providing an intuitive understanding of the processes. Students need to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers when they learn to solve equations in chapter 3. In the end of the chapter students also learn about negative fractions.</p><p>The lesson about distance contains a formula that may look unfamiliar to the teacher. You can find the distance between two integers by taking the absolute value of their difference. In symbols, the distance between a and b is | a &#x2212; b | . The idea behind the formula is simple, though, and most people use that idea instinctively without knowing about the formula. For example, how far apart from each other are 14 and 92? To solve that mentally, we find their difference, but we take that difference in a positive sense. In other words, we do not calculate 14 &#x2212; 92 = &#x2212;78 and state that the distance is negative 78 units, but instead, we say the distance is 78 units because distance is always positive. The absolute value takes care of that: it turns any negative quantity into a positive one.</p><p>In the next chapter (chapter 3) students study simple one-step equations. They already know the basics of how to solve this type of equations from 6th grade, but this time we use negative numbers in them.</p><p>Chapter 4 is titled <i>Rational Numbers</i>, which are simply fractions and certain decimals, so the student is already very familiar with them. The goal of the chapter is to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide both positive and negative fractions and decimals. We also solve simple equations involving fractions and decimals and learn about scientific notation and complex fractions.</p><p>The last chapter in part 7-A focuses on linear equations. The student learns to solve various types of linear equations and practices using those in simple word problems. We study linear inequalities but not to the same depth as linear equations. Lastly, the student graphs linear equations and is introduced to the concept of slope, which is the steepness of a line. The student will continue studying these topics with more details in an Algebra 1 Course.</p></p><p></p><h2>Angry All The Time: An Emergency Guide To Anger Control</h2><p><p>If you&#x2019;ve picked up this book, chances are you&#x2019;re someone with a serious anger problem.

Not an in-depth source by any means, this survey will be useful to students intrigued by the science of uncovering the past or merely looking for another source for report material. For the teacher looking for resources to create an archaeology curriculum, or to spice up an ancient history unit already in place, it will be valuable. In the hands of enthusiastic adults, and combined with other less textbookish works, such as W. John Hackwell's Digging to the Past (Scribner's 1986; o.p.), Michael Avi-Yonah's Dig This! How Archaeologists Uncover Our Past (Runestone, 1993), or Xavier Hern&nbsp;ndez's handsome Lebek: A City of Northern Europe through the Ages (Houghton, 1991; o.p.), it may open a wide window on the pageant of human history stretching behind our present.<p></p><p><i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Standard Baking Co.

What if they buried their treasure in a vast network of remote locations across the South and the Southwestern United States, and appointed sentinels to guard them -- sentinels who passed the secrets of this treasure from generation to generation? What if the keys to this fantastic treasure were hidden in a series of mysterious coded maps? <br><br> In <i>Rebel Gold,</i> investigative journalist Warren Getler and Bob Brewer, a descendant of one of the Confederate sentinels sworn to protect this treasure, uncover the truth behind the legend of this buried gold and the group rumored to have hidden it, the Knights of the Golden Circle. A fast-paced blend of history and modern-day detective story, Rebel Gold reveals a shadowy chapter in American history -- and how its legacy may be continuing to this day.</p><p><b>Warren Getler</b> is an investigative journalist based in Washington, D.C. Previously he has been a New York-based financial reporter for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and a London and Frankfurt correspondent of the <i>International Herald Tribune.</i><br><br><b>Bob Brewer</b> is a U.S. Navy Vietnam War veteran who grew up in Hatfield, Arkansas. Since retiring from the Navy, he has returned to Arkansas to devote his time to investigating the mysteries of the Knights of the Golden Circle.Conspiracy connoisseurs tired of contemplating whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone will feast on this tale of the 19th-century doings of the Knights of the Golden Circle. According to treasure hunter Brewer (aided by Bloomberg News editor-at-large Getler), who attempts to unravel their secrets in hopes of finding millions of dollars of hidden gold, the KGC was a sinister group of influential Southerners intent on engineering the secession of Southern states. They supposedly conspired to split the 1860 Democratic convention so that a weak candidate would emerge, guaranteeing Lincoln's election and support for secession-a deep game indeed. Losing the Civil War sent them underground, where, the authors say, political theorist and KGC member Jesse James, whose death they faked, led them to amass a fortune primarily through the pedestrian crimes of bank and stagecoach robbery and, more creatively, by collecting a multimillion-dollar award from Mexican Emperor Maximilian as repayment for aiding Maximilian's tottering regime. They hid their treasure, preserving knowledge of its whereabouts through a series of devilishly complex symbols known only to initiates for the day the South would rise again. Brewer believes some of his relatives were "sentinels" charged with protecting the KGC's hidden treasure. As fanciful as the group's history sounds (and the authors admit it is heavily based on circumstantial evidence), Brewer is convincing that the code existed and that he deciphered some of it, and his treasure hunting meets with modest success. In the end, this is a curiosity that will strain many readers' credibility, but leave a lingering "Maybe."

Juan Zarate, a chief architect of modern financial warfare and a former senior Treasury and White House official, pulls back the curtain on this shadowy world. In this gripping story, he explains in unprecedented detail how a small, dedicated group of officials redefined the Treasury's role and used its unique powers, relationships, and reputation to apply financial pressure against America's enemies.<br><br>This group unleashed a new brand of financial power-one that leveraged the private sector and banks directly to isolate rogues from the international financial system. By harnessing the forces of globalization and the centrality of the American market and dollar, Treasury developed a new way of undermining America's foes.

Omalu told her about a day in September 2002, when, in a dingy morgue in downtown Pittsburgh, he picked up a scalpel and made a discovery that would rattle America in ways he&#x2019;d never intended. Omalu was new to America, chasing the dream, a deeply spiritual man escaping the wounds of civil war in Nigeria. The body on the slab in front of him belonged to a fifty-year-old named Mike Webster, aka &#x201c;Iron Mike,&#x201d; a Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, one of the greatest ever to play the game. After retiring in 1990, Webster had suffered a dizzyingly steep decline. Toward the end of his life, he was living out of his van, tasering himself to relieve his chronic pain, and fixing his rotting teeth with Super Glue. <i>How did this happen?,</i> Omalu asked himself. <i>How did a young man like Mike Webster end up like this?</i> The search for answers would change Omalu&#x2019;s life forever and put him in the crosshairs of one of the most powerful corporations in America: the National Football League. What Omalu discovered in Webster&#x2019;s brain&#x2014;proof that Iron Mike&#x2019;s mental deterioration was no accident but a disease caused by blows to the head that could affect everyone playing the game&#x2014;was the one truth the NFL wanted to ignore.<br> &nbsp;<br> Taut, gripping, and gorgeously told, <i>Concussion</i> is the stirring story of one unlikely man&#x2019;s decision to stand up to a multibillion-dollar colossus, and to tell the world the truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>Concussion</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;A gripping medical mystery and a dazzling portrait of the young scientist no one wanted to listen to . . . a fabulous, essential read.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Rebecca Skloot, author of <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The story of Dr. Bennet Omalu&#x2019;s battle against the NFL is classic David and Goliath stuff, and Jeanne Marie Laskas&#x2014;one of my favorite writers on earth&#x2014;makes it as exciting as any great courtroom or gridiron drama.

Her writing has appeared in <i>GQ, Esquire, The New York Times Magazine, O: The Oprah Magazine,</i> and many other publications.

He&#x2019;s all in gray, beautifully tailored, sleek as a dolphin, cuff links, a half Windsor knot. One thing Bennet appreciates about the American legal system is that the attorneys always dress impeccably like this. The same cannot be said, by the way, about scientists. Half of why he couldn&#x2019;t survive academia was because of the sartorial slobbery. Shirttails hanging out, moccasins, saggy-ass jeans. It was too much.<br><br> &#x201c;Good morning, Doctor.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good morning, sir.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Doctor, would you please state your name for the members of the jury?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My name is Bennet Omalu, B-E-N-N-E-T, Omalu, O-M-A-L-U.&#x201d;<br><br> Already the jurors are exchanging glances. What did he say? His accent is thick. He needs to enunciate or something.<br><br> &#x201c;Dr. Omalu, I&#x2019;m going to ask you to speak into the microphone so all the members of the jury will be able to hear you. If you&#x2019;ll wait for just a moment, I&#x2019;ll give you a bottle of water.&#x201d;<br><br> He waits for the water. The whites of his eyes pop like flashbulbs. His face is round, a perfect circle, like a smiley-face button on a teenager&#x2019;s backpack. It might make him appear calmer than he is. Does he appear calm? Thank you, thank you. He tries to appear calm. He is almost never calm. He is a man who thinks in double exclamation points. Excitable!! Everyone tells him he looks much younger than his thirty-nine years. Maybe because he&#x2019;s short, he&#x2019;ll say. He&#x2019;s short because they didn&#x2019;t have much of anything to feed him during the war, he&#x2019;ll joke. It&#x2019;s not a joke, actually. His sisters think it&#x2019;s funny. Anyway, he likes it when people say he looks young. Also he likes to talk about himself. I&#x2019;m a Christian. I&#x2019;m a humble man. I surrender to God&#x2019;s mercy and love. There&#x2019;s an inwardness about him, but also a happy-go-lucky veneer of innocence.<br><br> He twists the cap off the bottle of water, sips.<br><br> Honestly, right now he wouldn&#x2019;t mind a cigarette. He hasn&#x2019;t smoked in years, hasn&#x2019;t even thought about it, but right now a cigarette might be a terrific help. Cigarettes and kola nuts were how he survived the stress of med school. The green nuts, he broke them with his thumbs, plucked the fleshy lobes, and chewed them like taffy. There is no quicker kick of caffeine than the one a man gets from kola nuts. His father and everyone in the village in Nigeria, they thought the nuts were holy. His father in his tall red hat, three feathers standing high as if touching the spirit world, saying the Ibo blessing: &#x201c;Ihe d� mma onye n&#x2019;ach�, � ga-af� ya.&#x201d; Whatever good he is looking for, he will see it. The men washing fingers, peanut butter dip, prayers, elders in robes.<br><br> Bennet doesn&#x2019;t miss any of that business. Honestly, none of it. He never wanted anything to do with those tedious old-world village rituals. He would be a man of his time. In America. Everything back home in Nigeria was about busting loose from the pettiness, the corruption, the wicked tendencies of man.<br><br> Now he&#x2019;s in America, in 2008, stuck in a boiling hot courtroom in Pittsburgh, and it feels like everything is once again about busting loose from the pettiness, the corruption, and the wicked tendencies of man. The irony is not lost on him. Thank you, God. I&#x2019;m grateful you got me to America. I am truly grateful. But the irony is not lost on me.<br><br> &#x201c;Dr. Omalu,&#x201d; the lawyer says, &#x201c;would you tell the members of the jury, please, how you are currently employed?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the chief medical examiner of San Joaquin County in the central wine valley region of California,&#x201d; he says, turning then to the court reporter with that super-straight posture, typing madly. &#x201c;S-A-N J-O-A-Q-U-I-N,&#x201d; he says.<br><br> &#x201c;How long have you been the chief medical examiner in San Joaquin?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My official appointment started September 1, 2007.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Can you tell us, please, where San Joaquin County is located, give us a sense of where it is on the map?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about one hour east of San Francisco and about forty-five minutes south of Sacramento, which is the capital of the state of California. It&#x2019;s located in the central wine valley. In San Joaquin. We produce the Zinfandel. Zinfandel red wine . . . Zinfandel grapes. You find wine in San Joaquin&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> Oh my God, shut up about the wine! What are you, the Chamber of Commerce? That was so stupid. He&#x2019;s nervous. He&#x2019;s so angry. He does not want to be here. He looks down, taps his feet together, reaches down to yank at one sock, then the other, wipes a speck of dust off his shiny new shoe.<br><br> He got these shoes for the trial. Black cap-toe oxfords, shiny as tar. He wanted them wider. He told the guy, he said, wider? The guy said no, they&#x2019;ll stretch. But they&#x2019;re not stretching. Tight, like a band across the cuneiform bones, the cuboid bone, the navicular bone. Everything feels so tight, oh my gosh! His collar. The span of pin-striped wool across his back. Everything should not feel so tight. He&#x2019;s testified in court hundreds of times; he&#x2019;s gotten guys off death row, for God&#x2019;s sake. A courtroom is not unfamiliar territory&#x2014;and this courtroom specifically, in Pittsburgh, this is the one he knows best. This is where he used to live. This is where he made his mark. He needs to just calm himself down and remember he is here because he has to be, not because he wants to be. Bennet, you are just a child of God doing your imperfect best in an imperfect world.<br><br> &#x201c;Dr. Omalu,&#x201d; the prosecutor says, &#x201c;how long have you been living in the United States, sir, either as a student or working as a professional?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I came to the United States in October 1994.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are you married, sir?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you have any children?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have a five-month-old daughter.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is that your only child?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;In what country were you born, Doctor?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I was born in Nigeria, West Africa.&#x201d;<br><br> The prosecutor glances at his notes, as if planning to move on past the introductions. He has fat eyebrows. A turnip nose. The heat in the courtroom is cranked way too high, an old boiler system, so the windows are cracked and you can hear the February wind whistle.<br><br> The prosecutor is not done with the introductions. &#x201c;Can you outline very briefly for the members of the jury,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;what your educational background was prior to coming to the United States?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I attended medical school in Nigeria,&#x201d; Bennet says. He explains how it works there, six years, then a clinical internship, then mandated paramilitary service&#x2014;three years doctoring in a rural village in the mountains. &#x201c;I was the only physician,&#x201d; he says, leaning into the microphone. &#x201c;My primary responsibility was to stop people from dying.&#x201d;<br><br> He reaches inside his collar, pulls where it pinches. He toggles his tie. This is a full Windsor knot. Many American presidents throughout history wore a full Windsor knot. Bennet thinks Barack Obama should at least try it. But instead Obama goes for the relaxed four-in-hand knot, a much less commanding statement. Bennet keeps all his ties already tied, loosened, in his closet, ready for action. That is the secret to always having a perfect, presidential full Windsor knot.<br><br> &#x201c;Dr. Omalu, correct me if I&#x2019;m wrong, you&#x2019;re board certified in four separate areas of pathology, is that correct?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Those are anatomic, clinical, forensic, and neuropathology.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br> Dutifully, he explains how all that happened, coming to America, the research scholarship, the second medical degree at Columbia University.&nbsp;<br><br> Two medical degrees?<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; He chose forensic pathology as his specialty. &#x201c;A specialist in death, why and how death occurs.&#x201d;<br><br> Becoming an expert in death would seem to be a counterintuitive move for a physician, a person committed to saving lives. He would need an entire afternoon to explain to the jury how he ended up doing autopsies for a living; none of this had been in his plan for his life. None of this.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Just to round out the academic picture here,&#x201d; the prosecutor says, &#x201c;you are also currently finishing up one other degree?&#x201d;<br><br> Two more, actually, for a total of seven. &#x201c;I have a master&#x2019;s in public health in epidemiology. I did that at the University of Pittsburgh. I&#x2019;m also completing in May, thankfully, May of this year, a master&#x2019;s in business administration at Carnegie Mellon University, which I&#x2019;m happy about completing. That is it.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;You are not going to get any more degrees?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No. My father said, Bennet, you should retire as a professional student when you turn forty, and I&#x2019;m turning forty this year.&#x201d;<br><br> Heh. A little levity. He looks over at the jury&#x2014;two rows of blank faces. Do they even understand him? He knows people sometimes have a hard time.<br><br> There is one person in the courtroom who understands him. The defendant, his former boss, Dr. Cyril Wecht. He&#x2019;s over there at the table, a ghost in Bennet&#x2019;s peripheral vision. Bennet hasn&#x2019;t even been able to look at Wecht. That is so juvenile. Come on, Bennet, just look at him.</p><h2>She Stoops to Conquer (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)</h2><p>This charming comedy has delighted audiences for over two centuries. First performed in 1773, it concerns Kate Hardcastle, a young lady who poses as a serving girl to win the heart of a young gentleman too shy to court ladies of his own class. A number of delightful deceits and hilarious turns of plot must be played out before the mating strategies of both Kate Hardcastle and her friend Constance Neville conclude happily. Along the way, there is an abundance of merry mix-ups, racy dialogue and sly satire of the sentimental comedies of Goldsmith's day.<br>The extraordinary humor and humanity with which Goldsmith invested this play have made it one of the most read, performed, and studied of all English comedies. It is now available in this inexpensive Dover edition, based on the text of the fourth edition, published in the year of the play's first staging.</p><p>The plays of Aurand Harris have been produced and applauded in thousands of productions around the world for nearly a half century. Harris was a prodigious dramatist, writing a new published play each season. He was a tireless experimenter of forms, themes, subjects. This modest man of irrepressible imagination and energy carried a vast array of honors and accolades. He was the first recipient of a National Endowment of the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in Children&#39;s Theatre. He received an honorary doctorate from a mid-western university, and was introduced into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. He was the first playwright to receive the Medallion of the Children&#39;s Theatre Foundation of America.Comedy in five acts by Oliver Goldsmith, produced and published in 1773. This comic masterpiece mocked the simple morality of sentimental comedies. Subtitled The Mistakes of a Night, the play is a lighthearted farce that derives its charm from the misunderstandings which entangle the well-drawn characters. Mr. Hardcastle plans to marry his forthright daughter Kate to bashful Marlow, the son of his friend Sir Charles Marlow. Mrs. Hardcastle wants her recalcitrant son Tony Lumpkin to marry her ward Constance Neville, who is in love with Marlow&#39;s friend Hastings. Humorous mishaps occur when Tony dupes Marlow and Hastings into believing that Mr. Hardcastle&#39;s home is an inn. By posing as a servant, Kate wins the heart of Marlow, who is uncomfortable in the company of wellborn women but is flirtatious with barmaids. Through various deceptions, Tony releases himself from his mother&#39;s clutches and unites Constance with Hastings. --The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</p><h2>Alberic the Wise and Other Journeys</h2><p>Three tales of wonder<br>Three quests for greatness<br>Three feats of imagination<br>&nbsp;<br>Norton Juster, author of the beloved classic The Phantom Tollbooth, shares spellbinding stories that entertain and delight.&nbsp; The first is of Alberic and his endless search for wisdom&#x2014;will his journey satisfy him in the end?

While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, a national bestseller, or a Hugo or Nebula award-winner, we are committed to publishing quality books from a diverse group of authors.</p><p>No Bio*Starred Review* Reynolds' collection constitutes excellent reading and confirmation of his reputation as one of the best writers of contemporary space opera. "Zima Blue" is about an artist who works in a color named for him and has progressed from small to star-sized installations; it concludes with the final piece of his career and reveals his mysterious past; the story's animating idea is the common-enough concept of a robot that has far surpassed its original role, but Reynolds takes it to greater lengths and handles it with especial style. "Beyond the Aquila Rift" is one of those stories about the hazards of interstellar travel, especially when using technology that isn't entirely reliable, and a particularly interesting example of the kind it is. One tale doesn't trade in the far future but instead revolves around a man whose wife has just died and his brief interaction with her doppelganger in a parallel universe; it is touching and sweet, ideally balancing technology and character development. "Spirey and the Queen" started as part of Reynolds' Revelation Space universe but became something quite different, involving an ancient war and strange machine intelligences. Reynolds does short stories with particular flair, and this collection contains some spectacular sf storytelling. <i>Regina Schroeder</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Instead, they are taught they should live a life of unbroken success, defined by promotions at work and beautiful wives and honor students at home.<br><br> The Catholic author, speaker, counselor, and radio host will show that when you practice meekness, you will connect with your family by asking them questions and listening closely to their responses. By practicing mercy, you come to know your own sins, the difficulties that lie on the path to sainthood, and how your family needs to hear about God's grace in their lives.<br><br> In <i>BeDADitudes</i>, you discover the profound love of God found in the Beatitudes and understand how that love can transform you into being an awesome dad.</p><p><b>Gregory K. Popcak</b>&nbsp;is a psychotherapist, the executive director of Pastoral Solutions Institute, and the author&nbsp;or coauthor of&nbsp;more than twenty popular books and programs integrating Catholic theology and counseling psychology.

The couple has three children and lives in Ohio."Greg Popcak gives the modern dad an invaluable gift. In clear and practical terms, Popcak creates not only a vision for being a successful father but a strategy to get there. His examples are relevant and plausible, and the results will be seen almost immediately in the lives of dads everywhere. In a culture that is suffering from a pandemic of fatherlessness, both physically and emotionally, <i>BeDADitudes</i> is an antidote that will not only change families but, ultimately, save souls." --<b>Mark Hart</b>, Catholic author, speaker, radio host, and executive vice president at Life Teen International<br><br> "Greg Popcak delves into Jesus' teachings found in the Sermon on the Mount and pulls out powerful, life-changing ideas for dads that will help them influence their families and change our world." --<b>John Bergsma, </b>Author of<i> Bible Basics for Catholics</i><br><br> "Our culture often distorts how men should relate to their wives and children. <i>BeDADitudes</i>seeks to fix that misshapen image with the beauty of Catholic wisdom. Insightful, practical, and balanced, Greg Popcak gets at the heart of what men think and feel, busting the myths and charting a path to authentic Catholic fatherhood. Highly recommended for any man seeking to be a better dad and lead his family closer to God." --<b>Marc Cardaronella</b>, Author of <i>Keep Your Kids Catholic</i><br><br> "Our culture is in the midst of a great crisis of fatherhood resulting in devastating consequences. We need a resurrection of authentic Christian fathers. In <i>BeDADitudes</i>, Dr. Gregory Popcak issues a compassionate and convicted call to return to the fatherhood found in the heart of God. Using the eight Beatitudes found in the gospels, Popcak outlines the character of authentic fatherhood, and teaches us that we can't learn to be good fathers until we've learned to be good sons. With humor, insight, and an accessible style, he answers common misconceptions and challenges men to embrace the greatness of being a vocational dad.

His writings, translated into many languages, have established him as one of the world&#39;s leading authorities in intelligence history. Professor Andrew is also a frequent host of BBC TV and radio programs on history and world affairs.Much of the value returned on America's multibillion-dollar spending on intelligence depends on what the ultimate consumer, the president, does with it. Too often the sum is wasted if he ignores it or wants fortune-telling clairvoyance from it. But a few presidents have justified the expense with their realistic use of confidential information. Writing about each chief executive, Andrew blends the organizational growth of U.S. spy agencies (mostly ad hoc entities until the cold war spawned the CIA and NSA) with presidential predilections of the moment. FDR preferred espionage gathering on people (he was indifferent, unlike Churchill, to the signals intelligence that was possibly decisive in World War II); aerial surveillance tripped up Ike in the U-2 affair; and Nixon's undoing was his penchant for snooping on domestic political opponents. When not telling a revealing anecdote, such as Wilson's naive use of a simple cipher the British had no trouble cracking, Andrew aims his fluid analysis at the intelligence successes and failures in the foreign policy realm--in all, a fascinating synthesis from a premier author of a half-dozen previous espionage histories. An excellent companion acquisition is G. J. O'Toole's Honorable Treachery (1991), a history of U.S. intelligence operations. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Frank: The Voice</h2><p><p>Frank Sinatra was the best-known entertainer of the twentieth century&#x2014;infinitely charismatic, lionized and notorious in equal measure.

Read his review of <em>Frank: The Voice</em>:</b></p> <p>There has never been a book of this kind or quality about Frank Sinatra. Like the formidable novelist he is, James Kaplan has somehow managed to get inside the man and the legend, to such a degree that you feel you are living Sinatra&#x2019;s life with him, almost day by day. Yet it is the fastest read.</p> <p>From his violent, deforming, traumatic birth, through his Hoboken childhood with a super-dominating mother and a weak father, through the heady, unprecedented bobby-sox years, his young marriage to the virtually saint-like Nancy, their three kids, his numerous--almost serial--infidelities, through the tumultuous affair with Ava Gardner--detailed as never before--through the much-frowned-on divorce, the suicide attempts, rivetingly onward through the near total collapse of his career, and right up through the miraculous comeback with the Oscar for <em>From Here to Eternity</em>,this book tells it all with the freshness of the first time, in the most engrossing and evocative prose. There is compassion and candor, and a profound sense of real lives being lived.</p> <p>Sinatra the musician has never been taken as seriously or chronicled with such sensitivity and depth; it has never been as clear how very much the singer had to do with all aspects of his recordings and performances. This is a warts-and-all work, with a staggering amount of research to back everything up, revealing Nancy Sr. in all her grace, and Frank in all his moods, but it is never salacious or malicious, only honest, forthright and civilized. Nobody can be prepared for the life of a phenomenon--which Sinatra was--the first show business phenomenon of the 20th century, long before Elvis or the Beatles, and far more complicated and multi-layered. Being very human, Frank did the best he could with it all, and James Kaplan has done a magnificently resonant chronicle of the first half of an incredible journey.

With my right hand, I steadied my quivering spaniel and tried to keep her from toppling out of the basket. Still, even one-handed, I swear I would&#x2019;ve made the turn with no problem.<br> &nbsp;<br> Except. Except the girl was standing in the middle of Maddox Street. I shouted, &#x201c;Hey, watch out!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Too late. I had to let go of Little Roo. I grabbed both handlebars and pulled hard to the left. I wasn&#x2019;t quick enough. My right pedal struck the girl&#x2019;s shin; we all went down. I banged my left knee. The pan clattered away and LR tumbled out of the basket. She bounced up and began barking and twirling in circles like a crazy windup toy. Overhead, bombers roared. From the ground, ack-ack guns shot defensive fire into the sky. I scrambled to my feet, rubbing my knee.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; I yelled over the din.<br> &nbsp;<br> The girl didn&#x2019;t answer at first. I reached out a hand to help her up. She pushed it away. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you watch where you&#x2019;re going?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me? You were standing in the street! You&#x2019;re lucky I wasn&#x2019;t a bus: You would&#x2019;ve been crushed flat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then I stopped. Pointless. It was pointless to argue. I could tell from her accent that the girl was an American. The city was crawling with them. Soldiers in uniform, journalists, navy and army officers sporting stripes and medals, young women in crisp American Red Cross uniforms. Everyone had come to prepare for the invasion of France. It was the only way the Allies could defeat Hitler and end the war.<br> &nbsp;<br> I knew as well as anyone that we needed the Americans, but there was a part of me that resented these strangers. They hadn&#x2019;t been here during the worst of it. Three years ago, the Blitz had gone on and on. We&#x2019;d lived through all-night bombing raids, incendiary bombs designed to burn London to the ground, rubble and destruction on street after street. A lot of kids had been sent to the countryside. My older brother, Will, and I had begged to stay.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Americans hadn&#x2019;t lived through that. Compared to us Londoners, they seemed to burst with hope and energy. Maybe they just ate better. They had money to eat in restaurants, where (so we heard) you could&nbsp; still get &#x201c;real&#x201d; food. They hadn&#x2019;t spent years waiting in long queues, ration cards in hand, to buy food that didn&#x2019;t taste much like food.<br> &nbsp;<br> Latecomers. Too late to change what had happened to us.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad, as always, looked on the bright side. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t achieve victory without them, Bertie,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;Britain needs American troops and trucks and tanks. We need them all. Be polite when you encounter anyone from the United States.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And so I tried again. &#x201c;Sorry I knocked you down, miss. I&#x2019;m a civil defense volunteer. It&#x2019;s my job to tell you to get to the shelter immediately. It&#x2019;s just up the street.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The girl snorted as she stood. She brushed off her coat. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look very official. You look like a kid. And was that a tin pan on your head?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I felt my face burn. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thirteen. It&#x2019;s just . . . this is the first time I&#x2019;ve been on duty during a raid and I couldn&#x2019;t find--&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That was as far as I got. All at once, the night splintered apart. Whoomph. Bam!<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get down!&#x201d; I hollered. I had just enough time to grab LR and throw myself to the pavement. I curled over her warm, furry body and whispered, &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be all right, girl.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We were lucky. I felt the ground shake, but the bomb had hit nearby, most likely a block or two away. I glanced up to check on the stranger. What is she even doing out alone at dusk? I wondered. Most people headed inside on a late winter afternoon, especially now that the German bombing raids had begun again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Please, miss . . . it&#x2019;s not safe to be out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The girl shot to her feet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to go.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And then she was gone, flying off down the street, her dark blue coat flapping against her thin legs. Good, I thought. Maybe the noise has scared her. Maybe she&#x2019;ll follow directions and get to safety.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go past the big church on your left,&#x201d; I bellowed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see the sign for the shelter to your right.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t be entirely sure, but it looked as if she&#x2019;d darted right past it. I shrugged. Well, she wasn&#x2019;t my problem. Time to get to the command post.<br> &nbsp;<br> LR wriggled out of my arms and started sniffing around. I went searching for the tin pan to stick back on my head. Next thing I knew, LR was at my feet, tail spinning like a propeller. Woof! Out came a muffled bark. Her little jaws were clamped onto something. &#x201c;What have you got, LR? Drop it!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I was about to reach for the object when the sound of footsteps startled me. I turned to see an older couple passing by, heading in the same direction as the girl. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, dear,&#x201d; the man called to the woman. &#x201c;Almost there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a civil defense volunteer,&#x201d; I hollered. &#x201c;Take shelter now!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thanks, lad, but we&#x2019;re almost home,&#x201d; the man said, reaching out to grab his wife&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a Morrison shelter under our kitchen table. We&#x2019;ll be safe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A hatless young man with short dark hair came bounding right behind them. I tried my warning again. &#x201c;Get to the shelter!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He shot me a frown. I had a quick impression of an angular face and intense, blazing eyes. He looked preoccupied, as if he had something else on his mind besides ack-ack guns. And then, like the other three, he hurried off down Maddox Street.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I give up! No one pays me any attention,&#x201d; I complained to LR, who was still wagging and waiting for me to claim what she&#x2019;d discovered. I picked up a battered red notebook, small enough to fit in my trouser pocket. I slipped it in without thinking much about it, then reached out for LR.</p><h2>A Sermon Workbook: Exercises in the Art and Craft of Preaching</h2><p><p>Every preacher, from the novice to the most experienced, needs fresh inspiration to build new skills and to inject creativity into their sermon preparation. </p> <p><em>A Sermon Workbook</em> addresses the essentials for effective preaching in our multi-tasking, multi-ethnic, sound-bite society.

Written with the full cooperation of each of the group&#x2019;s members and their intimates, this book tells the inside story of the music and the madness, the feuds and the drugs, the marriages and the affairs&#x2014;from the greatest heights to the self-destructive depths of the Fab Four.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>In-depth and definitive,&nbsp;<b>The Love You Make</b> is an astonishing account of four men who transformed the way a whole generation of young people thought and lived.

One of the suit men--as the Beatles dismissively, often with good reason, called the folk who saw to their business affairs--recreates the well-known saga of Beatlemania but does it dispassionately enough to make it interesting. Brown, who directed the Beatles management firm NEMS and later their disastrous financial organization Apple, seems to have survived the experience unscathed, the purges, rancor, glamour, notoriety, the dishonesty, jealousy and infighting among all those who wanted a piece of the action, or a bigger cut, which eventually came to include the musicians themselves as the group began to split apart. While seeming to be objective, he leaves little doubt about his preferences as he discusses the Beatles individually, their parents and in-laws, wives and lovers, probing the personalities to show us the underside of the pop culture with its sleazy pursuit of the big buck. There are revelations about John and Yoko and about their drug addiction, but the material is otherwise pretty familiar. Still, it's a dramatically good story and Brown catches us with the headiness of it all--and Gaines's now well-known name and a new foreword by rock critic Anthony DeCurtis may spark a little extra interest. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wildwood: A Journey Through Trees</h2><p>Here, published for the first time in the United States, is the last book by Roger Deakin, famed British nature writer and icon of the environmentalist movement. In Deakin&#39;s glorious meditation on wood, the &#34;fifth element&#34; - as it exists in nature, in our culture, and in our souls - the reader accompanies Deakin through the woods of Britain, Europe, Kazakhstan, and Australia in search of what lies behind man&#39;s profound and enduring connection with trees. Deakin lives in forest shacks, goes &#34;coppicing&#34; in Suffolk, swims beneath the walnut trees of the Haut-Languedoc, and hunts bushplums with Aboriginal women in the outback. Along the way, he ferrets out the mysteries of woods, detailing the life stories of the timber beams composing his Elizabethan house and searching for the origin of the apple. As the world&#39;s forests are whittled away, Deakin&#39;s sparkling prose evokes woodlands anarchic with life, rendering each tree as an individual, living being. At once a traveler&#39;s tale and a splendid work of natural history, Wildwood reveals, amid the world&#39;s marvelous diversity, that which is universal in human experience.</p><p><b>Roger Deakin</b>, who died in August 2006, shortly after completing the manuscript for <i>Wildwood</i>, was a writer, broadcaster, and filmmaker. His previous book, <i>Waterlog</i>, recounts his swimming adventures and has been hailed as a classic of nature writing.<i></i><p><i>Staying Put</i></p><p>While the rest of the world has been playing musical chairs all around me, I have stayed put in the same house for more than half my life. It's not that I don't like to wander, but somehow I feel easier in my freewheeling knowing that this place is here, a fixed point. I am located by it, just as Donne's lovers are the twin points of compasses in his poem <i>A Valediction, Forbidding Mourning</i>:</p><blockquote>Thy firmness draws my circle just,<br>And makes me end where I begun.</blockquote><p>The adventures of my mother's family, the Woods, all nine of them, were the stuff of my bedtime stories. My mother never seemed to read to me but recounted instead the many tales of the Wood tribe. I grew up in a strictly oral tradition of home-grown folklore peopled almost entirely by my mother's siblings. Welsh Grandma Jones, silver-haired Grandpa Wood, with his one left hand and a steel hook for his right, two dashing uncles and four aunts. My grandparents had upheld our sylvan traditions by christening two of them Ivy Wood and Violet Wood. My mother was always thankful nobody had thought of Primrose.</p><p>Wood family history is ingrained in me, just as memory and history are ingrained into the timbers of Walnut Tree Farm.

If you take a cross-section of any beam, close study of the pattern of its annual rings by a dendrochronologist would reveal exactly when it grew up from the acorn or the coppice stool, and exactly when it was cut down.</p><p>The house sits at a dizzy 174 feet above sea level, enough to keep my patch islanded when the promised flood comes. But I am part-islanded already by a moat and a round cattle pond that juts out into the common, one of twenty-four that are strung around it and connected by an ancient system of moats and drains. The jungled hedges that surround my four meadows comprise a necessary rampart to the winds that cut across the open wheat prairies beyond. They have vaulted the ditches, creating a secret leaf-mould world of ferny tunnels. There's a little wood too, and an old droving road that flanks the land to the west.</p><p>All of this lies on the shores of a great inland sea of rippling grasses that rises like a tide towards haymaking in July, obscuring my neighbour's farm on its far side. It stretches a mile to the west of this place, the biggest grazing common in Suffolk. So, although the sea is twenty-five miles due east at Walberswick, I can still enjoy some of the pleasures of living beside it: the big skies and wide, dramatic sunsets. In Suffolk we have daydream mountains too: the volcanic cumulus clouds of harvest time.</p><p>Why have I stayed so long? Not because I was born here or have Suffolk roots, but because of all the hard work, and the accumulated history. I mean my own, mixed up with the people I love. For three years I taught English at the old grammar school in Diss, putting more roots down among the local students and families who became my friends. There is no more intimate way of getting to know your neighbours than by teaching their children. Then there were the Barsham Fairs and the <i>Waveney Clarion</i>, the community newspaper of the Waveney Valley, which I helped write, plan and distribute, as a whole extended family of us quasi-hippies did, from Diss to Bungay to Beccles to Lowestoft. The rural culture we built together then during the 1970s and early 1980s, based firmly on the values of the <i>Whole Earth Catalogue</i>, Friends of the Earth, Cobbett's <i>Cottage Economy</i> and John Seymour's <i>The Fat of the Land</i>, flushed out all the pioneer immigrants busy settling in Suffolk - rough carpenters, dirt farmers, musicians, poets, ditchdiggers and drivers of timber-framed Morris Minor estate cars - and put us all to work together building what for a golden moment became a grand tradition of Suffolk fairs, ephemeral, dreamlike, gypsyish shanty capitals in fields full of folk. Again, it was work - creative, bold, imaginative but at the same time hard, manual and physical - that drew us together. A shared experience of risk too: you never knew what the weather would do or if anyone would turn up at the gate and pay for it all. Dancing and music played a big part. We had our own local heroes, our own Suffolk Bob Dylans and Willie Nelsons, and any number of ceilidh bands sawing away in village halls on Friday nights.</p><p>The house was a ruin when I found it in 1969. I noticed a chimney rising just above the treetops of a spinney of ash, maple, hazel, elder, blackthorn, ivy and bramble, and what was left of a cottage orchard of walnut, greengage and apple. Like everyone else in the village, Arthur Cousins, the owner, clearly thought the house had crept away to hide itself and discreetly die, like an old cat. He lived across the fields at Cowpasture Farm with his daughters Beryl and Precious, keeping pigs in the old house downstairs, chickens upstairs. The roof was a patchwork of flapping corrugated iron, and the remaining damp, composting thatch was so verdant with grass and moss it could have been turf. I love ruins because they are always doing what everything really wants to do all the time: returning themselves to the earth, melting back into the landscape. And though it is long since I moved in, nature has refused to relinquish all kinds of ancient rights of way through the place.</p><p>For several weeks I paid court to Arthur at Cowpasture Farm, and eventually he consented to sell me the house and twelve acres. We went on to become the best of friends, even sharing Heather, a big-eyed Guernsey house-cow, whom we took turns to milk. Arthur was one of the last generation of the old Suffolk horse men. For most of his life he had been an independent timber-hauler with his own gang of heavy horses and carts, plying the roads between Norwich and Ipswich, hauling timber from the woods to the sawmills, timber yards and shippers. He worked hard, saved up and bought his farm before the war, when land was cheap. He still hung hagstones, Suffolk's flint version of the evil eye, in his stables and cowsheds to ward off the nightmare who might disturb his animals as they slept in their stalls. He was my tutor in husbandry, animal lore and village politics.</p><p>Slowly, I stripped the house to its skeleton of oak, chestnut and ash, repairing it with oak timbers gleaned from a barn one of the local farmers had demolished. I lived in the back of a Volkswagen van for a while, then made a bivouac around the big central fireplace and slept beside a wood fire with two cats for company. The hearth became the most sacred, numinous place in the house. It lies at its centre, and is the only part that still opens to the skies. In spring, I moved upstairs into what felt like a tree house, sleeping under the stars as I repaired the open rafters in a perch with a canvas roof. Soon the wood-pigeons roosting in the ash tree at eye level grew used to me. The tree felt then, as it does now, like a guardian of the house, arching up over the roof in a kind of embrace, and I fought the council building inspector tooth and nail to retain it.</p><p>I found myself then, as I still do deep down, in love with the place as a ruin and therefore partly at odds with myself as its healer. I liked the way the wattle-and-daub walls, baked by the sun to a biscuit, were cratered all over where they faced south, like the peepholes of a Yemeni city, by nesting mason bees or solitary wasps. I appreciated the inquisitive tendrils of ivy that poked their heads in through the cracks in the rotted windows, fogged green with algae, patterned by questing snails. I welcomed the sparrows and starlings fidgeting in the thatch or under the tin, and the bats that later flitted through the tented open rafters as I lay dozing in bed, limbs aching sweetly from a long day's labour. I wanted to repair the walls, but at the same time to foster the passepartout menagerie that refused to recognize them. Somehow, through the sum of minor inefficiencies in a handmade wood-framed house, I succeeded.</p><p>Having personally shaped or repaired every single one, I have ended up on terms of the greatest intimacy with all the beams, posts and pegged joints in the place. I have perhaps also earned some kinship with the people who, twenty years or so before Shakespeare was born, originally built the house and probably dug out the moat. Uncovering the carpenters' coded inscriptions on the rafters and floor beams was like finding a lost manuscript. They were carved when the oak or sweet chestnut was still green and the house under prefabricated construction in a kind of kit form at the carpenters' shop, ready to be carted to the site and raised, whole walls at a time, by the combined muscle of dozens of villagers. The proportions of everything, measured in feet and inches, impressed on me the organic nature of the entire structure. The proportions of each room, and of the house as a whole, were predicated on the natural proportions of the trees available. Suffolk houses like mine tend to be about eighteen feet wide, because that is about the average limit of the straight run of the trunk of a youngish oak suitable in girth for making a major crossbeam of eight inches by seven. The bigger barns tend to twenty-one feet wide, with slightly bigger timbers. Uprights too are of tree height, the idea being to select trees or coppice poles of about the right cross-section, so they can be squared with an adze with the minimum of work.</p><p>This is the beam count in my house. Kitchen: 44. Sitting room: 50. Study: 32. Upstairs landing, bathroom and study: 22. Small bedroom: 23. Big bedroom: 72. Total: 243. If I add all 30 hidden beams in the kitchen, as well as 50-odd rafters, the total is 323 beams. So some 300 trees were felled to build this house: a small wood. The bark is still on many of these timbers after 400 years, and so is the sapwood here and there. The timber was always worked in its green, unseasoned condition, when it is easiest to cut, drill or shape into joints. Once assembled into the hardwood frame, the timbers would gradually season in situ, often twisting or curving as they did so and creatin...</p></p><h2>All That I Can Be (Little Critter): A Graduation Gift for Kids (Pictureback(R))</h2><p><b>A perfect graudation gift all about growing up, featuring the one-and-only, Little Critter!</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>Mercer Mayer&#x2019;s Little Critter and his little sister wonder how things will be when they grow up in these funny and heartwarming classic stories.

This could also be termed as one of the many miracles of the Quran. Accordingly, if a reader decides to learn only 10 new words every day, he can understand the basic message of the Quran within a period of seven months! So it is indeed very easy to understand the Quran, provided one is willing to learn it. This word-for-word translation may not be considered as an addition to the existing translations, but an attempt to equip the reader to understand the revelation directly from the Arabic text; thus it will Insha-Allah be a very useful tool for those who are willing to study the Quran and try to understand it. A beginner can bear in mind the meanings of each Arabic word provided right below it. Since many words are repeated in the Quran, the student will find for himself that within a few months of regular study, he is indeed able to understand the Quran through the text itself. It may also be pointed out that a beginner does not have to, in the start itself, be worried about learning extensive grammar or how to speak the Arabic language. In fact, one has to develop vocabulary before learning grammar for the following reasons: * A child first learns words and then starts linking them together. We speak our mother tongue fluently without ever learning the grammatical rules. That is to say, we learn it by repeatedly listening to the words. * Learning extensive grammar before improving vocabulary is like putting the cart before the horse. Or it is like learning different styles of swimming by moving hands in the air inside a swimming pool without water. One has to fill the swimming pool with water (i.e., increase vocabulary) and then learn to swim (i.e., to connect the words with grammatical rules).</p><p>Dr Shehnaz Shaikh is a Medical Doctor by professional qualifications.

Leeming includes substantial essays on the worlds major mythological traditions, on mythological types and motifs, on mythological figures, and on numerous related subjects such as fairly tales and legends. The <em>Companion</em> also locates myth in our lives today, relating it to psychology, religion, science, politics, art, and much more. <br><br>From King Arthur and the Round Table to Jonah and the Whale, from the wicked and destructive Norse trickster Loki to the great mother goddess of Chinese mythology Nuwa, here is a comprehensive and thoughtful look at mythology around the world.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Leeming</strong> is Emeritus Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Connecticut. His many books include <em>Myths, Legends, and Folktales of America</em>, with Jake Page, <em>A Dictionary of Asian Mythology</em> and <em>Myth: A Biography of Belief</em>. He lives in Riverdale, New York.<br>In the introduction to this work, Leeming, an emeritus professor of English and comparative literature who has written extensively on mythology, defines myths as "religious narratives that transcend the possibilities of common experience and that express any given culture's literal or metaphorical understanding of various aspects of reality." Covering a broad range of belief systems dating from prehistoric times to the twenty-first century, this compendium not only traces the myths of various cultures but also shows how a number of common elements thread through many sacred stories from disparate geographic areas.<p>Ranging in length from a single sentence to multiple pages, the approximately 1,500 entries cover deities and other mythological figures (<i>Artemis, Job,</i> <i>Thor</i>); heroic epics and other stories (<i>Iliad,</i> <i>Volsunga Saga</i>); motifs (<i>Afterlife,</i> <i>Flood</i>); mythologists (<i>Campbell</i>, <i>Joseph</i>; <i>Frazer, Sir James</i>); sacred books (<i>Qur'an,</i> <i>Upanishads</i>); and the mythologies of particular regions, religions, or cultures. Only a small percentage of the entries include references to sources for further information. Access is facilitated by a section that categorizes entries by cultural groups or broad topics, a network of cross-references, and an index. Adding visual appeal are a number of black-and-white illustrations and color plates, most of which reproduce artworks that depict mythological themes. Additional features include a lengthy bibliography, family trees for five major pantheons, and charts identifying Greek-Roman and Sumerian-Babylonian equivalent deities.</p><p>With more than twice as many entries, the two-volume <i>Facts On File Encyclopedia of World Mythology and Legend</i> (2004) identifies many more mythological figures than does Leeming's work. In addition, specialized sources such as <i>The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion </i>(2004) and <i>Dictionary of Celtic Mythology </i>(Oxford, 1998) offer more in-depth coverage of specific mythological cultures. The strength of <i>The Oxford Companion to World Mythology</i> lies in its overview articles on mythologies of particular eras and cultures and in its thematic entries that bring together mythological concepts from a variety of traditions.</p><p>Scholarly but rarely abstruse, this reasonably priced volume is particularly suitable for academic and larger public libraries. <i>Marie Ellis</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It sheds light on the extraordinary assumptions that underlay much of this research - and on the vaccines that developed from this. The author, an investigative journalist who has researched and produced investigative films for the BBC, American and Australian television, was asked by parents with children severely ill after vaccination, to discover if the medical authorities were hiding anything from them. She agreed, but had no idea how long this search would take. She expected at best to uncover a small degree of contamination. On the ensuing decade-long journey of discovery, she learnt it is not just the added mercury that we have to worry about. She discovered that the top government scientists admit to colleagues that vaccines are contaminated with viruses from chickens, humans and monkeys, with RNA and DNA fragments, with &#39;cellular degradation products&#39;, and possibly &#39;oncogenes and prions.&#39; They report alarmingly that it is impossible to commercially purify vaccines. They express great concerns, but the public is not told despite the possible consequences for long-term public health. A recent US court decision has linked autism with vaccine contamination. The author cites her sources by name - and gives references and Internet links where they are available. I She reveals evidence that the World Health Organisation has discovered the MMR vaccine is contaminated with chicken leukosis virus, but has decided not to tell the public of this, and to continue to make the vaccine with eggs from contaminated chickens. She reports US biowarfare researchers tried to create new agents to destroy our immune systems - and worked on a bacterium to make it a hospital superbug. Did they manage to create HIV? A senior professor told her that the vaccine program was so contaminated that HIV might well have spread though it without any need for military intervention. She set out to find the evidence to resolve this, and to learn how HIV apparently spread so far and fast. She needed to know more about this virus so went to the foundation research widely held today to have found HIV and proved it caused AIDS. She was then rocked to discover that this same research was investigated for scientific fraud for a five year period by powerful US scientific institutions and by Congress,. Why is this not widely known? She found their reports and discovered they found major errors in this research, some so serious that these made it impossible to repeat these experiments and thus to verify them! She reveals the evidence unearthed - reproducing key documents so the reader can assess them for themselves. This is explosive material. In the final part of this book the author reports recent research that is revolutionising biology and offering much hope for the future. These new developments shed new light on the relationships between our cells and viruses. They are not necessarily enemies. Readers may find these new developments radically change the ideas they have held about viruses since childhood.

He also said: 'It is very comforting to read in Fear of the Invisible: 'We have all been taught to greatly fear viruses - yet scientists are now discovering that they are fundamental parts of live, made by the million by all healthy cells. I hope this book will help by combating this fear, this damning of the invisible because we do not understand it. Without this fear, hopefully the focus in medical research will shift to looking more at the environmental toxins that really do put us, and our world, gravely at risk."</p>Janine Roberts is an international investigative journalist of some 40 years standing, during which time she has written for major newspapers in the UK and Australia, authored historical and investigative books and made investigative films seen on US, UK and Australian television.</p><h2>Ralph Compton Brimstone Trail (A Ralph Compton Western)</h2><p><b>In this Ralph Compton western, the road to hell is a short ride....</b><br><br>Before hearing the call of the Lord, Paul had seen more than his share of sin&#x2014;mostly his own.

Many reasons have been advanced for the continuing fascination of this epic tragedy, but none, we think, can contribute as much to an understanding of it as the four accounts collected in this volume.<br>All four authors were survivors, and each presents the catastrophe from his own viewpoint; the icy waters, the cries of the drowning, the confusion, and the heroism, are given an intensely personal immediacy.<br>This volume contains, complete and unabridged, "The Loss of the S.S. Titanic," by Lawrence Beesley, and "The Truth about the Titanic," by Col. Archibald Gracie. Both are full-length books published soon after the disaster. Each has become extremely rare today. The third story in this volume, "Titanic," was written by one of the only officers to survive the catastrophe, Commander Lightoller. It includes the story of the "white-washing" inquiries into the <i>Titanic</i>'s safety measures. The last section is a dramatic tale by the <i>Titanic</i>'s surviving wireless operator, Harold Bride.</p><p>This invaluable book collects some of the first-published first-person accounts of the tragedy, described in old-fashioned prose and enhanced by photographs and illustrations redolent of Edwardian society, with captions such as "Ladies and gentlemen in riding habit exercised on mechanical horses and camels in the ship's gymnasium." Some of the social attitudes of the day are preserved to often startling effect: the habits of obedience of "the Teutonic race" are repeatedly praised, and one brave <i>Titanic</i> officer used what the book's introduction terms "the strange ethical algebra which decided that one female, travelling first class, deserved life some six times as much as one male, travelling third class." Yet it's just such period detail that makes this book so compelling--not to mention the vivid sense that the passengers just didn't get it, even while disaster was upon them. "To illustrate further how little danger was apprehended," writes survivor Lawrence Beesley, "when it was discovered ... that the forward lower deck was covered with small ice, snowballing matches were arranged for the following morning....

A natural draughtsman, master of colour and hugely influential artist, Klee eludes classification, having been variously linked with Expressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism and Abstraction. Part of a new series of beautiful gift art books, <i>Paul Klee Masterpieces of Art</i> brims with the subtle warmth and humour of a unique artist. With a fresh and thoughtful introduction to Klee's life and art, the book goes on to showcase his key works in all their glory.</p><p>Susie Hodge is an art historian, author and artist with over 80 books published, mainly on art and history.

In the modern church it tends to be the last part of the Bible that anyone looks at seriously. Because Leviticus is largely concerned with subjects that seem incomprehensible and irrelevant today &#x2014; rituals for sacrifice and regulations concerning uncleanness &#x2014; it appears to have nothing to say to twenty-first-century Christians. In this excellent commentary on Leviticus, Gordon Wenham takes with equal seriousness both the plain original meaning of the text and its abiding theological value. To aid in reconstructing the original meaning of the text, Wenham draws from studies of Old Testament ritual and sacrifice that compare and contrast biblical customs with the practices of other Near Eastern cultures. He also closely examines the work of social anthropologists and expertly utilizes the methods of literary criticism to bring out the biblical author&#x2019;s special interests. In pursuit of his second aim, to illumine the enduring theological value of Leviticus, Wenham discusses at the end of each section how the Old Testament passages relate to the New Testament and to contemporary Christianity. In doing so, he not only shows how pervasive Levitical ideas are in the New Testament but also highlights in very practical ways the enduring claim of God&#x2019;s call to holiness on the lives of Christians today.</p><p>These twin convictions, shared by all of the contributors to the New International commentary On The Old Testament, define the goal of this ambitious series of commentaries. For those many modern readers who find the Old Testament to be strange and foreign soil, the NICOT series serves as an authoritative guide bridging the cultural gap between today&#39;s world and the world of ancient Israel. Each NICOT volume aims to help us hear God&#39;s word as clearly as possible.Gordon J. Wenham is professor of Old Testament at the University of Gloucestershire, England. His other books include <em>Story as Torah</em> and <em>Exploring the Old Testament: The Pentateuch.</em></p><h2>Perfect Scoundrels (A Heist Society Novel, 3)</h2><p>Katarina Bishop and W.W. Hale the fifth were born to lead completely different lives: Kat comes from a long, proud line of loveable criminal masterminds, while Hale is the scion of one of the most seemingly perfect dynasties in the world. If their families have one thing in common, it&#39;s that they both know how to stay under the radar while getting-or stealing-whatever they want. No matter the risk, the Bishops can always be counted on, but in Hale&#39;s family, all bets are off when money is on the line. When Hale unexpectedly inherits his grandmother&#39;s billion dollar corporation, he quickly learns that there&#39;s no place for Kat and their old heists in his new role. But Kat won&#39;t let him go that easily, especially after she gets tipped off that his grandmother&#39;s will might have been altered in an elaborate con to steal the company&#39;s fortune. So instead of being the heir-this time, Hale might be the mark. Forced to keep a level head as she and her crew fight for one of their own, Kat comes up with an ambitious and far-reaching plan that only the Bishop family would dare attempt. To pull it off, Kat is prepared to do the impossible, but first, she has to decide if she&#39;s willing to save her boyfriend&#39;s company if it means losing the boy.</p><p>Ally Carter (www.allycarter.com) is the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of the four previous books in the Gallagher Girls series: <em>I'd Tell You I Love You, But Then I'd Have to Kill You</em>; <em>Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy</em>; <em>Don't Judge a Girl By her Cover</em>; <em>Only the Good Spy Young</em>; and <em>Out of Sight, Out of Time</em>, as well as <i>Heist <em>Society</em> </i>and its sequel <i>Uncommon Criminals</i>. Ally lives in Oklahoma, where she is hard at work on her next novel.The stakes are not only higher but also personal in this third Heist Society novel. Teen criminal mastermind Katarina Bishop gathers her fellow con artists to help one of their own, W. W. Hale the Fifth, when Hale&#x2019;s wealthy tycoon grandmother dies suddenly&#x2014;and mysteriously&#x2014;leaving control of her billion-dollar corporation to underage Hale and the family&#x2019;s greedy trustee lawyer. This time Kat&#x2019;s not after cursed jewels or stolen paintings but the original will&#x2014;even if it means losing Hale in the process. While jet-setting around the globe, scheming elaborate break-ins, and even pulling off a &#x201c;Basil E. Frankweiler&#x201d; maneuver in a high-security London museum, Kat must keep her feelings for Hale in check. Can she trust her usually steadfast partner? Further complicating this cinematic caper is the meeting of Kat&#x2019;s under-the-radar relatives and Hale&#x2019;s socialite family.

In this book that Messianic theme is traced from its announcement in the Old Testament through its development between the Testaments to its fulfillment in the New Testament. The book also examines how Jews and Christians have continued to debate this subject down until today. There are also some studies on fascinating related subjects like the location of the Temple and the ashes of the Red Heifer. While these chapters have been written from a Christian perspective, adequate attention has also been given to Jewish concerns. The Messiah was successively revealed, rejected and received. This book explains how and why that happened. &#34;In this book, Will Varner has opened the Scripture to provide a readable, clarifying look at Jesus, the Messiah of Israel and the Savior of the world. Jesus once asked His disciples, &#34;Who do men say that I am? (Mark 8:27). That is still the most urgent question - who is this Jesus? You will find the answer powerfully and convincingly provided in this outstanding book.

When faced with complex situations, we have all become accustomed to looking to our leaders to set out a plan of action and blaze a path to success. Harford argues that today's challenges simply cannot be tackled with ready-made solutions and expert opinion; the world has become far too unpredictable and profoundly complex. Instead, we must <i>adapt.</i></p><p>Deftly weaving together psychology, evolutionary biology, anthropology, physics, and economics, along with the compelling story of hard-won lessons learned in the field, Harford makes a passionate case for the importance of adaptive trial and error in tackling issues such as climate change, poverty, and financial crises&#x2015;as well as in fostering innovation and creativity in our business and personal lives. </p><p>Taking us from corporate boardrooms to the deserts of Iraq, <i>Adapt </i>clearly explains the necessary ingredients for turning failure into success.

It was invented in 1893, roughly halfway between the appearance of the light bulb and that of the aeroplane. This century-old technology is now a household staple. Reliable, efficient toasters are available for less than an hour&#x2019;s wage. &nbsp;Nevertheless, Thomas Thwaites, a postgraduate design student at the Royal College of Art in London, discovered just what an astonishing achievement the toaster is when he embarked on what he called the &#x2018;Toaster Project&#x2019;. Quite simply, Thwaites wanted to build a toaster from scratch. He started by taking apart a cheap toaster, to discover that it had over four hundred components and sub-components. Even the most primitive model called for:&nbsp;Copper, to make the pins of the electric plug, the cord, and internal wires. Iron to make the steel grilling apparatus, and the spring to pop up the toast. Nickel to make the heating element. Mica (a mineral a bit like slate) around which the heating element is wound, and of course plastic for the plug and cord insulation, and for the all important sleek looking casing. &nbsp;The scale of the task soon became clear. To get iron ore, Thwaites had to travel to an old mine in Wales that now serves as a museum. He tried to smelt the iron using fifteenth-century technology, and failed dismally. He fared no better when he replaced bellows with hairdryers and a leaf-blower. His next attempt was even more of a cheat: he used a recently patented smelting method and two microwave ovens, one of which perished in the attempt, to produce a coin-sized lump of iron. &nbsp;Plastic was no easier. Thwaites tried but failed to persuade BP to fly him out to an offshore rig to collect some crude oil. His attempts to make plastic from potato starch were foiled by mould and hungry snails. Finally, he settled for scavenging some plastic from a local dump, melting it down and moulding it into a toaster&#x2019;s casing. Other short cuts followed. Thwaites used electrolysis to obtain copper from the polluted water of an old mine in Anglesey, and simply melted down some commemorative coins to produce nickel, which he drew into wire using a specialised machine from the RCA&#x2019;s jewellery department. &nbsp;Such compromises were inevitable. &#x2018;I realised that if you started absolutely from scratch, you could easily spend your life making a toaster,&#x2019; he admitted. Despite his Herculean efforts to duplicate the technology, Thomas Thwaites&#x2019;s toaster looks more like a toaster-shaped birthday cake than a real toaster, its coating dripping and oozing like an icing job gone wrong. &#x2018;It warms bread when I plug it into a battery,&#x2019; he told me, brightly. &#x2018;But I&#x2019;m not sure what will happen if I plug it into the mains.&#x2019; Eventually, he summoned up the courage to do so. Two seconds later, the toaster was toast.</p><h2>Lancelot</h2><p>________________ Conn Iggulden has called it &#39;a masterpiece&#39; while The Times has hailed it &#39;a gorgeous, rich retelling of the Arthurian tale&#39; . . . ________________ Rome is burning. In Britain, Uther Pendragon is dying. Enemies stalk his land. Into this uncertain world a boy is cast - an outsider, plagued by memories of those he&#39;s lost. Under the watchful eye of Merlin, the boy begins his journey to manhood. He meets another outcast, Guinevere - wild, proud and beautiful. And he is dazzled by Arthur - a warrior who carries the hopes of the people like a flaming torch in the dark. But these are treacherous times, and the fate of Britain rests on a sword&#39;s edge. This young man becomes a lord of war: loved, hated, admired and feared. He is a man forsaken but not forgotten. He is Lancelot. ________________ Set in a 5th century Britain besieged by invading bands of Saxons and Franks, Irish and Picts, Giles Kristian&#39;s epic new novel tells - in Lancelot&#39;s own words - the story of the most revered yet reviled of all Arthur&#39;s knights, the warrior who fought at his lord&#39;s side - yet stole his wife. This is the story of one of the great figures of British myth and legend - a story ready to be re-imagined for our times.</p><p></p><h2>Little Penguin Gets the Hiccups Board Book</h2><p><p>A sweetly hilarious tale of icebergs, chili, and playful surprises that puts its reader at the very center of the story&#x2014;now in board book format!

It was her first picture book. She lives in England.K-Gr 2-Little Red is one tough cookie. When a menacing wolf blocks the path to her grandmother's house, she looks him in the eye, answers his questions, and continues on her journey. The wolf "might have scared some little girls. But not this little girl." This phrase is repeated throughout the story. Woollvin's street-smart character cannot be fooled by the wolf, even when he dresses up as her grandma. Little Red "wasn't fooled for a minute." The familiar phrases of "Oh, Grandma! What big ears you have" and "What big ears and teeth you have" are included in this story, but the little girl doesn't wait for a woodsman to save her. She dispatches the wolf herself with an axe that she carries into the cabin. The dark humor continues to the end when readers see Little Red journeying home not in her red cape but in a shaggy wolfskin. The gouache and digital illustrations were made with black, gray, and red only. The close-ups of the wolf's face and Little Red's eyes add a sense of fright to the story. There is no bloodshed on the pages, but easily scared children might not like a couple of the illustrations.

Bullinger was one of the most prolific writers among theologians of the 19th century. His outstanding scholarship resulted in classics such as Number in Scripture. In The Witness of the Stars, Bullinger takes the reader back in time before God had given a written revelation. He asks the question, Did God leave Himself without a witness? Bullinger resoundly ansers NO! He then proceeds to show how God declared his sovereignty over creation through the stars in the heavens. Bullinger strips away pagan falsehoods to reveal how the heavens truly proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ as the only hope of salvation. Originally published in 1893, Alacrity Press is proud to make this classic book available to our generation.</p><p><p>Building upon ancient astronomical sources and current scientific data, E.W. Bullinger displays how the constellations bear witness to the accuracy of biblical prophetic truths. Numerous celestial charts and diagrams are provided to lend vivid support to his conclusions. With the psalmist, one discovers that "the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth His handiwork," thus encouraging Bible students to look upward for the coming of Christ.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Bullinger takes Psalm 19 and, using it as a base, expands the understanding of astronomy to include confirmation of God's word. This book is of value to the advanced student of Christian evidences, and for the average Christian it will give greater appreciation for God&#x2019;s handiwork in the heavens. </p>E. W. Bullinger (1837-1913) was an Anglican clergyman, theologian, and Biblical scholar. He was also a direct descendant of Johann H. Bullinger, the Swiss reformer. Bullinger was a lifelong scholar and writer studying at King's College, London. In 1862 he was ordained in the Church of England. He is also the author of the notes and appendixes of &#x201c;The Companion Bible&#x201d; and the author of numerous works including &#x201c;Commentary on Revelation,&#x201d; &#x201c;Great Cloud of Witnesses,&#x201d; &#x201c;How to Enjoy the Bible,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Numbers in Scripture.&#x201d;</p><h2>Treatise on Toleration (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>One of the most important essays on religious tolerance and freedom of thought, a French bestseller in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In 1762 Jean Calas, a merchant from Toulouse, was executed after being falsely accused of killing his son.

After creating artwork for famous Detroiters and for display at the World&#39;s Fair and helping to build WWII bombers, Gwen moved her printmaking business to northern Michigan. She dedicated her work and her life to reminding people of the wonder and beauty in nature.</p><p><p>Received the <em>Award</em> "<strong>Michigan Notable Book.</strong>"</p> <p>This enchanting picture book biography shines the spotlight on a little-known environmental pioneer and talented artist and businesswoman. ---Washington Parent This wonderful picture book tells the story of a singular woman who, despite physical challenges, pursued a life in art that made her happy.

"What you get out of [magic] can be measured precisely by what you are willing to put into it- and time is the essential ingredient in successful magical training," the authors write. And just as no one expects to run a marathon or play a Bach violin concerto without sufficient training, so practitioners of the magical arts shouldn't expect to work complex, powerful magical rituals without a solid grounding in the techniques of Hermetic high magic. By spending at least a half hour a day practicing the lessons found in <i>Learning Ritual Magic</i>, the solitary apprentice attains the proper groundwork and experience for working ritual magic.</p><br><br><p><i>Learning Ritual Magic</i> provides lessons on meditation and a set of exercises designed to develop basic skills in imagination, will, memory, and self-knowledge, all of which are absolute fundamentals to magical attainment.

Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Maud'dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family&#x2015;and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream.</p><p>A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, <i>Dune</i> won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. Frank Herbert's death in 1986 was a tragic loss, yet the astounding legacy of his visionary fiction will live forever.</p></p><p>This Hugo and Nebula Award winner tells the sweeping tale of a desert planet called Arrakis, the focus of an intricate power struggle in a byzantine interstellar empire. Arrakis is the sole source of Melange, the "spice of spices." Melange is necessary for interstellar travel and grants psychic powers and longevity, so whoever controls it wields great influence. <p> The troubles begin when stewardship of Arrakis is transferred by the Emperor from the Harkonnen Noble House to House Atreides. The Harkonnens don't want to give up their privilege, though, and through sabotage and treachery they cast young Duke Paul Atreides out into the planet's harsh environment to die. There he falls in with the Fremen, a tribe of desert dwellers who become the basis of the army with which he will reclaim what's rightfully his. Paul Atreides, though, is far more than just a usurped duke. He might be the end product of a very long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human; he might be a messiah. His struggle is at the center of a nexus of powerful people and events, and the repercussions will be felt throughout the Imperium. </p><p> <i>Dune</i> is one of the most famous science fiction novels ever written, and deservedly so.

His teenage son, Matt, fills a Squirtmaster 9000 for his turn at a high school game called Killer. Matt's intended victim, Jenny Herk, sits down in front of the TV with her mom for what she hopes will be a peaceful evening for once. Jenny's alcoholic and secretly embezzling stepfather, Arthur, emerges from the maid's room, angry at being rebuffed. Henry and Leonard, two hit men from New Jersey, pull up to the Herks' house for a real game of Killer, Arthur's embezzlement apparently not having been quite so secret to his employers after all. And a homeless man named Puggy settles down for the night in a treehouse just inside the Herks' yard.<br><br>In a few minutes, a chain of events that will change the lives of each and every one of them will begin, and will leave some of them wiser, some of them deader, and some of them definitely looking for a new line of work. With a wicked wit, razor-sharp observations, rich characters, and a plot with more twists than the Inland Waterway, Dave Barry makes his debut a complete and utter triumph.</p><p>Dave Barry, the only newsman to win a Pulitzer for exemplary use of words like <i>booger</i>, will please humor and crime-fiction fans alike with this racy debut novel. The scene is Miami. In ritzy Coconut Grove, the teen son of Eliot, a newsman turned adman, sneaks up to spritz a cute girl with a Squirtmaster 9000 to win a high school game called Killer. Meanwhile, two hit men sneak up to kill the girl's abusive stepdad, Arthur. Arthur cheated his bosses at corrupt Penultimate, Inc., which equipped a Florida jail with automatic garage-opener gates that accidentally freed prisoners in a lightning storm. <p> Farcical confusion ensues, witnessed by a saintly bum named Puggy, camped in a tree in Arthur's yard. Puggy works at the Jolly Jackal Bar &amp; Grill, which has no grill and actually sells guns and bombs to an offshoot of the Crips and Bloods called the Cruds, and to Penultimate (which plans to conquer Cuba). But when dim thugs Eddie and Snake rob the Jolly Jackal and Arthur tells them it's a Russian mob front selling bombs, the proprietor snorts, "<i>Bombs, pfft!</i> No bombs! Is bar."</p><p> Can Snake and Eddie spirit a suitcase nuke through Miami, "where most motorists obeyed the traffic and customs of their individual countries of origin"? Can Eliot and cop Monica Rodriguez save the day? And how do the 300-pound hallucinogenic Enemy Toad, the 13-foot-long python Daphne, highway goats, and the Denture Adventure seniors' theme park fit in? Everything fits perfectly, including a few dark passages new to Barry's work. But one warning: if you read this book while drinking milk, at some point it will spurt out of your nostrils. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Dave Barry is a humor columnist.

"Have you noticed that people come in many different shades?" is the opening sentence, accompanied by framed head shots of youngsters. It is followed on the next page by, "Not colors, exactly, but shades." The text is minimal, with approximately 3 to 10 words per page. The last page features a large photograph of eight little hands of varying shades. The message is clear and to the point: "Our skin is just our covering, like wrapping paper. And, you can't tell what someone is like from the color of their skin." A good introduction to racial and ethnic diversity.&#x2014;<i>Mary N.

Astrid hugging little Caroline and Henry. Luna barking and licking all the faces she could reach. <br>Of course, we were all wearing five layers of clothing to protect our skin from the compounds. And I had on my air mask. And Chloe was off to the side, masked and layered up and lying in a drugged sleep on an inflatable mattress. But for us, in the Greenway, it was a nice moment. <br>Seeing Astrid kiss them all over their little, dirty, freckled faces made me feel hopeful and happy. I guess seeing Astrid expressing love for them made my own feelings for her swell up. I felt like my heart would burst. <br>Then Astrid took in a deep breath. <br>And I saw her nostrils flare. She inhaled too long and I knew the rage was kicking in. <br>&#x201c;Why did you stay?&#x201d; she moaned. &#x201c;You dumb, DUMB KIDS. WHY DID YOU STAY?&#x201d; <br>She crushed the twins to her chest, holding one of their redheaded skulls in each hand. <br>And then I had to tackle her and hold her down. <br>So much for lovely Greenway moments. <br>Caroline and Henry were crying as I wrestled Astrid to the ground. <br>&#x201c;Get her mask!&#x201d; I yelled. <br>Astrid lashed out, pushing up against me. <br>Luna was barking her fluffy white head off. <br>&#x201c;Caroline,&#x201d; I hollered, my voice muffled by my mask. &#x201c;Get her air mask! Bring it here.&#x201d; <br>Astrid had let it fall to the ground when she saw the twins and started hugging and kissing them. <br>Caroline brought me the mask, as Astrid kicked and bucked. It took everything I had to keep her down. <br>&#x201c;Put it on her!&#x201d; I shouted. <br>Caroline, crying hard, pressed the mask over Astrid&#x2019;s face. Henry came over and helped her hold it in place. <br>&#x201c;Stop fighting me!&#x201d; I yelled at Astrid. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re okay. You just got a hit of the compounds. Just breathe.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do it harder,&#x201d; Henry said to Caroline and she nodded. They crushed the mask down more firmly. <br>Astrid looked at us, at me. The fury in her sky-blue eyes receded, slowly, until finally she closed them and her whole body softened underneath me. <br>I stayed on top of her until she said hoarsely, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all right.&#x201d; <br>I got to my knees, then to my feet. <br>Astrid put her hand up and placed it on the mask, gently pushing the twins aside as she sat up. <br>Caroline patted Astrid on the back. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, we know it wasn&#x2019;t really you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Henry agreed. &#x201c;It was Monster-Astrid, not Real-Astrid.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come on, everyone,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We gotta fix the gate! Now!&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>We had needed to open the gate to let out the bus with Alex, Niko, Josie, and the rest of them. The layers of blankets and plastic and plywood we&#x2019;d used to seal the gate and make the store airtight were all messed up now. <br>First we had to reseal the gate and then, somehow, purify the air. Would the entire store be contaminated now? I didn&#x2019;t know. <br>I grabbed the blankets and plastic sheeting that hung from the gate and pressed them back into place. &#x201c;Hand me a staple gun!&#x201d; I shouted to the twins. <br>The staple guns were still there, set to the side, from the first time we&#x2019;d sealed the gate. I was now glad we were so sloppy as to leave our tools around. Or maybe Niko had left them there on purpose. He was very thorough that way. <br>I got the blankets and plastic back up in the time it took for Astrid to get to her feet and drag the first plywood sheet over. <br>I tried to staple it but only got three good hits when there was a hollow <i>CLINK-CLINK</i> sound from the staple gun. I was out of staples. <br>&#x201c;Shoot,&#x201d; I mumbled. <br>There weren&#x2019;t any extra staples in the box, either. <br>&#x201c;Be right back!&#x201d; I hollered. <br>You had to shout to be understood in the stupid air masks. <br>I didn&#x2019;t want to think about Niko and Josie and Alex trying to communicate through them on the bus. <br>They should never have left and every time it even came into my mind that they had left, I got angry. <br>I didn&#x2019;t need to be angry just then, though. I needed to be smart. We had to get the store sealed up quickly. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I headed to Home Improvement. <br>I passed Chloe on her air mattress. She still had her mask on and all her layers and was totally out cold. The sleeping pill Niko had given her was strong. <br>She was going to be so pissed off when she woke up and discovered that Niko and the rest had gone on without her. <br>She had missed the whole drama of Astrid and me telling everyone we weren&#x2019;t going. That it wasn&#x2019;t safe for us to go out, because of our blood type. <br>She certainly hadn&#x2019;t been consulted when Niko took her off the bus. <br>But we were right, I told myself. It <i>was</i> too dangerous for us to go out there. Astrid had gotten just a momentary whiff of the compounds and had gone berserk. Us out in the open air, trying to make it sixty miles to Denver? We would have murdered them. <br>I was sure of it. We made the right choice. <br>And we had enough supplies in the Greenway to last us for weeks or months. Long enough for the others to make it to DIA and arrange some kind of a rescue. Or long enough to wait out the compounds&#x2014;we had heard the effects would only last for three to six months.&#x2026; <br>As I got back with my reloaded staple gun, I saw that Caroline and Henry were gently bouncing next to Chloe&#x2019;s slumbering form on the air mattress. Luna was curled up next to them. <br>They looked like three little aliens and their pet dog, out to sea on a raft. <br>Then there came a loud <i>THUNK</i> from the gate. <br>Astrid jumped and looked at me. <br>The <i>THUNK</i> came again. <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; came a voice. <br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; Astrid yelled. <br>&#x201c;I knew it! I knew I saw a light! Hey, Jeff, I was right! There&#x2019;s somebody in there!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; I shouted. <br>&#x201c;Name&#x2019;s Scott Fisher. Open the gate and let us in, would ya?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t open it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, sure, you can. You just did. It was just open a minute ago. We saw the light! Come on!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah! Let us in,&#x201d; echoed another voice. Jeff, I presumed. <br>&#x201c;Dude, you have to let us in. It&#x2019;s like an emergency out here!&#x201d; <br>Dur. <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But we can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, why the hell not?&#x201d; he demanded. <br>Astrid came and stood next to me. <br>&#x201c;Because we let two grown-ups in before and one of them molested a girl and tried to shoot our leader!&#x201d; she shouted through her mask. <br>&#x201c;Well, now we&#x2019;re not like that. We&#x2019;re real nice.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Astrid said. She patted the plywood and nodded for me to nail it. <br>&#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re thirsty and hungry. People are dying out here! Let us in.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I yelled. <br>I shot a staple in. <br>Scott and Jeff rattled the gate some and cursed a fair amount, but by the time we got the rest of the plywood back up, we could hardly hear them. <br>I was examining the wall, and had made up my mind to add another layer of plastic sheeting, after we got the purifiers running, when Astrid tugged on my arm. <br>&#x201c;While we&#x2019;re all geared up, let&#x2019;s go throw some food down to that guy from the roof.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s throw them down some food and water!&#x201d; she yelled. <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I asked. <br>She shrugged. <br>&#x201c;We have so much and they have nothing. We should help them.&#x201d; <br>Aargh, I didn&#x2019;t want to go up on the roof. Not at all. <br>I was exhausted and I wanted to get the air purifiers set up. <br>But Astrid stood there looking at me like it was obviously a good idea. Like it was obviously the right thing to do. <br>&#x201c;I want to get air purifiers set up first,&#x201d; I argued. <br>&#x201c;Me and the kids will do that,&#x201d; she yelled through her mask. &#x201c;You should take the food up while the guys are still outside.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>I couldn&#x2019;t think straight enough to tell her why it wasn&#x2019;t a good idea. Maybe she&#x2019;d think I was lazy or scared to go on the roof or something. <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d; <br>She turned toward the kids without even, I don&#x2019;t know, saying thanks. <br>&#x201c;Caroline and Henry,&#x201d; she called. &#x201c;Grab a cart and come with me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;First we get the purifiers running. Then I take the food.&#x201d; <br>Astrid looked at me and sighed. <br>Okay, it&#x2019;s hard to read expressions through the plastic visor of an industrial face mask, but what I read in her expression went something like: <br>Ah, this dumb kid feels like he&#x2019;s getting pushed around so he&#x2019;s taking a stand on a small, insignificant detail. But I guess if he needs to win this little victory for the sake of his pride, then I will give in. <br>Then she said, &#x201c;Fine, but let&#x2019;s hurry.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>We had eight different models of air purifiers in the Greenway and four to six units of each. Astrid and I set up the larger ones, and Caroline and Henry were in charge of putting the smaller ones around the store. <br>We used a lot of extension cords, as most of the outlets were on the walls. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I headed to the Pizza Shack. We had moved all the food into the big refrigerators there when we realized we&#x2019;d be staying for a while. <br>I grabbed some EZ cans of tuna and a bunch of old bread and some fiber breakfast bars no one liked and some horrible Popsicles not even the least discriminating of our kids would eat. And a couple gallons of store-brand lemonade. <br>I threw the stuff into an empty plastic storage bin that was sitting around from before and carried it back to the storeroom. <br>We&#x2019;d been alone in the store for all of two hours and already she was bossing me around as if I were some little kid or something. Not good. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Holding the tub in my arms, I entered the storeroom backward, nudging the doors open with my back. <br>I turned and nearly dropped the tub. <br>I was so wrapped up in thinking about Astrid I had forgotten about the bodies. <br>It was bloody back there. Robbie&#x2019;s body lay half off the air mattress. The air had mostly gone out of the mattress, so his bloody corpse was just lying on a flattish rubber mat. The blanket we&#x2019;d thrown over top of him was saturated with blood in a couple of places. <br>Just beyond him lay Mr. Appleton, who had died in his sleep. A more peaceful way to go, to be sure. As if to prove it, his air mattress was still pleasantly inflated. <br>The outsiders who had come and torn our group apart were now dead in the storeroom. <br>I hadn&#x2019;t had time to really think about Robbie and the way he betrayed us. <br>He and Mr. Appleton had come to the store and we had let them in. But when it came time for them to leave, Robbie hadn&#x2019;t wanted to. Mr. Appleton fell ill and then, later that night, we had found Robbie with Sahalia. <br>In the scuffle, Brayden had been shot and Robbie had been killed. <br>Mr. Appleton died later in the night. There wasn&#x2019;t much we could have done to change that, I don&#x2019;t think. <br>But Robbie&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>I could have looked at Robbie there and been angry. As far as I understood it, he had tried to get Sahalia to sleep with him. Whether by force or by manipulation, I&#x2019;m not sure. But he showed his true colors and they were disgusting. A, like, fifty-year-old man with a thirteen-year-old? Disgusting. We thought he was a loving father-type guy and he turned out to be a letch. <br>And if Robbie hadn&#x2019;t assaulted Sahalia, Brayden would still be okay. Niko and Alex and the rest wouldn&#x2019;t have had to try to make it to Denver. <br>But I just felt sad. <br>Robbie and Mr. Appleton were just two more people dead from this chain of disasters. <br>The little kids knew nothing about what had happened and I had to keep it that way. <br>I added &#x201c;Hide the bodies&#x201d; to my mental list of things to do. <br>After I fed the stupid strangers outside the store. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The hatch to the roof was easy to unlock. Niko had fixed sheeting over it with Velcro, so you could just rip it open and it would hang off to the side. And the padlock had the key right in it. <br>I set the bin down on the step in front of me and pushed the hatch up and open. <br>The last time I&#x2019;d been on this roof we hadn&#x2019;t known anything about the compounds. We had watched the cloud going up from NORAD, thirty miles away. <br>The last time I&#x2019;d been on this roof I tried to kill my brother. <br>It was dark now. The air seemed to absorb the light seeping out from the hatch. The sky above was opaque black. No stars. No clouds. Just black mud suspended in the air. <br>I cursed myself for not bringing a flashlight. <br>I didn&#x2019;t want to go all the way back for one, though, so what I did was set the box down on the roof and scooted it toward the edge, crawling behind it. <br>I sure as hell didn&#x2019;t want to fall off the roof in the dark. <br>After a minute of undignified crawling and scooting, the bin came up against the edge of the roof. I tipped it up and over and listened to it come crashing down. <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; I heard Scott Fisher yell. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome!&#x201d; I hollered. <br>They&#x2019;d find the loot. And I&#x2019;d be inside by the time they did. <br>They were lucky Astrid had a nice streak in her and that I was such a pushover. <br>I edged my way back toward the light coming from the hatch. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to take the air mask off. <br>The whole mask/glasses combo was driving me crazy. The mask was large enough to fit over my glasses, but it made them cut into the bridge of my nose. And my nose was still battered from when Jake had beat me up, so that hurt. A lot. <br>And I wanted to get my layers off. The layers were starting to bunch up under my arms and behind my knees. <br>Again, I tried not to think about Alex and Niko and the rest. <br>They had sixty miles to cover, wearing their layers and air masks, on a half-fixed school bus on a dangerous and dark highway. And I was whining to myself about a couple of hours in layers and a mask. <br>I got to my feet and started to make my way, slowly, back toward the hatch. In a dark world, that leaked light looked really bright, I tell you. <br>But I went slowly, because the roof was uneven and dented in places from the hailstorm a million years ago that had landed us safely in the Greenway. <br>I was thinking about the hailstorm and about how lucky we were that the grade-school bus driver, Mrs. Wooly, had not only thought to drive the bus into the store to get the little kids out of the hail, but had then returned to rescue us high school kids. I was thinking about Mrs. Wooly and wondering what had happened to her in the end. Had she made it to safety? Had she even thought about returning for us, as she promised, or had she just decided to fend for herself? <br>I was thinking about Mrs. Wooly when the light from the hatch went out. <br>I was alone, on the roof, in the dark. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Emmy Laybourne <br></p><h2>Come from Away</h2><p>From the bestselling author of <i>Tides of Honour</i> and <i>Promises to Keep</i> comes a poignant novel about a young couple caught on opposite sides of the Second World War.<br><br>In the fall of 1939, Grace Baker&#x2019;s three brothers, sharp and proud in their uniforms, board Canadian ships headed for a faraway war.

My younger brother, Jonas, was asking questions. I asked questions, too, but perhaps I refused to acknowledge the signs. Only later did I realize that Mother and Father intended we escape. We did not escape.<br>We were taken.<br>June 14, 1941. I had changed into my nightgown and settled in at my desk to write my cousin Joana a letter. I opened a new ivory writing tablet and a case of pens and pencils, a gift from my aunt for my fifteenth birthday.<br>The evening breeze floated through the open window over my desk, waltzing the curtain from side to side. I could smell the lily of the valley that Mother and I had planted two years ago. Dear Joana.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t a knocking. It was an urgent booming that made me jump in my chair. Fists pounded on our front door. No one stirred inside the house. I left my desk and peered out into the hallway. My mother stood flat against the wall facing our framed map of Lithuania, her eyes closed and her face pulled with an anxiety I had never seen. She was praying.<br>&#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; said Jonas, only one of his eyes visible through the crack in his door, &#x201c;are you going to open it? It sounds as if they might break it down.&#x201d;<br>Mother&#x2019;s head turned to see both Jonas and me peering out of our rooms. She attempted a forced smile. &#x201c;Yes, darling. I will open the door. I won&#x2019;t let anyone break down our door.&#x201d;<br>The heels of her shoes echoed down the wooden floor of the hallway and her long, thin skirt swayed about her ankles. Mother was elegant and beautiful, stunning in fact, with an unusually wide smile that lit up everything around her. I was fortunate to have Mother&#x2019;s honey-colored hair and her bright blue eyes. Jonas had her smile.<br>Loud voices thundered from the foyer.<br>&#x201c;NKVD!&#x201d; whispered Jonas, growing pale. &#x201c;Tadas said they took his neighbors away in a truck. They&#x2019;re arresting people.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. Not here,&#x201d; I replied. The Soviet secret police had no business at our house. I walked down the hallway to listen and peeked around the corner. Jonas was right. Three NKVD officers had Mother encircled. They wore blue hats with a red border and a gold star above the brim. A tall officer had our passports in his hand.<br>&#x201c;We need more time. We&#x2019;ll be ready in the morning,&#x201d; Mother said.<br>&#x201c;Twenty minutes&#x2014;or you won&#x2019;t live to see morning,&#x201d; said the officer.<br>&#x201c;Please, lower your voice. I have children,&#x201d; whispered Mother.<br>&#x201c;Twenty minutes,&#x201d; the officer barked. He threw his burning cigarette onto our clean living room floor and ground it into the wood with his boot.<br>We were about to become cigarettes.</p><h2>The Dig Proverbs</h2><p>Are you looking for an easy and meaningful way to teach your kids the Bible?

With origins in Britain, the Craftsman style was a reaction against the excesses of the Victorian era. Craftsman bungalows were distinguished by their charming simplicity, cozy style, and storybook appeal. The name was derived from a popular magazine called <i>The</i> <i>Craftsman,</i> published by renowned furniture designer Gustav Stickley who sold plans for these homes designed for "beauty, convenience, and comfort." <br>This fascinating reprint of a rare architectural catalog is filled with photos of actual completed bungalows from the era, built prior to 1919. A mix of Spanish tile, stucco exteriors, wraparound porches, overhanging gables, handcrafted stone, and woodwork added up to many a homeowner's dream. Geared to the climate of the northern and eastern regions, each bungalow is an authentic Craftsman design and features a photo, description, floor plan, and original costs. A fascinating showcase of primary American architecture, <i>Craftsman Bungalows</i> is an indispensable resource for architects, builders, historians, and illustrators.</p><p>Architect Edward L.

It was a Saturday, the first week of August, and after helping his father sucker tobacco all morning he&#x2019;d had the rest of the day for himself. He&#x2019;d changed into his fishing clothes and driven three miles of dirt road to the French Broad. Travis drove fast, the rod and reel clattering in the truck bed, red dust rising in his wake. The Marlin .22 slid on its makeshift gun rack with each hard curve. He had the windows down, and if the radio worked he would have had it blasting. The truck was a &#x2019;66 Ford, battered from a dozen years of farm use. Travis had paid a neighbor five hundred dollars for it three months earlier. He parked by the bridge and walked upriver toward where Caney Creek entered. Afternoon light slanted over Divide Mountain and tinged the water the deep gold of curing tobacco. A fish leaped in the shallows, but Travis&#x2019;s spinning rod was broken down and even if it hadn&#x2019;t been he wouldn&#x2019;t have bothered to cast. Nothing swam in the French Broad he could sell, only hatchery-bred rainbows and browns, some smallmouth, and catfish. The old men who fished the river stayed in one place for hours, motionless as the stumps and rocks they sat on. Travis liked to keep moving, and he fished where even the younger fishermen wouldn&#x2019;t go. In forty minutes he was half a mile up Caney Creek, the rod still in two pieces. There were trout in this lower section, browns and rainbows that had worked their way up from the river, but Old Man Jenkins would not buy them. The gorge narrowed to a thirty-foot wall of water and rock, below it the creek&#x2019;s deepest pool. This was the place where everyone else turned back, but Travis waded through waist-high water to reach the waterfall&#x2019;s right side. Then he began climbing, the rod clasped in his left palm as his fingers used juts and fissures for leverage and resting places. When he got to the top he fitted the rod sections together and threaded monofilament through the guides. He was about to tie on the silver Panther Martin spinner when a tapping began above him. Travis spotted the yellowhammer thirty feet up in the hickory and immediately wished he had his .22 with him. He scanned the woods for a dead tree or old fence post where the bird&#x2019;s nest might be. A flytier in Marshall paid two dollars if you brought him a yellowhammer or wood duck, a nickel for a single good feather, and Travis needed every dollar and nickel he could get if he was going to get his truck insurance paid this month. The only fish this far up were what fishing books and magazines called brook trout, though Travis had never heard Old Man Jenkins or anyone else call them a name other than speckled trout. Jenkins swore they tasted better than any brown or rainbow and paid Travis fifty cents apiece no matter how small. Old Man Jenkins ate them head and all, like sardines. Mountain laurel slapped his face and arms, and he scraped his hands and elbows climbing rocks there was no other way around. Water was the only path now. Travis thought of his daddy back at the farmhouse and smiled. The old man had told him never to fish places like this alone, because a broken leg or rattlesnake bite could get a body graveyard dead before someone found you. That was about the only kind of talk he&#x2019;d ever heard from the old man, Travis thought as he tested his knot, always being put down about something&#x2014;how fast he drove, who he hung out with. Nothing but a bother from the day he was born. Puny and sickly as a baby and nothing but trouble since. That&#x2019;s what his father had said to his junior high principal, like it was Travis&#x2019;s fault he wasn&#x2019;t stout as his daddy, and like the old man hadn&#x2019;t raised all sorts of hell when he himself was young. The only places with enough water to hold fish were the pools, some no bigger than a washtub. Travis flicked the spinner into the front of each pool and reeled soon as it hit the surface, the spinner moving through the water like a slow bright bullet. In every third or fourth pool a small orange-finned trout came flopping onto the bank, treble hook snagged in its mouth. Travis slapped the speckleds&#x2019; heads against a rock and felt the fish shudder in his hand and die. If he missed a strike, he cast again into the same pool. Unlike brown and rainbows, speckleds would hit twice, sometimes even three times. Old Man Jenkins had said when he was a boy most every stream in Madison County was thick as gnats with speckleds, but they&#x2019;d been too easy caught and soon fished out, which was why now you had to go to the back of beyond to find them. eight trout weighted the back of his fishing vest when Travis passed the no trespassing sign nailed aslant a pin oak tree. The sign was as scabbed with rust as the decade-old car tag nailed on his family&#x2019;s barn, and he paid it no more heed now than when he&#x2019;d first seen it a month ago. He knew he was on Toomey land, and he knew the stories. How Carlton Toomey once used his thumb to gouge a man&#x2019;s eye out in a bar fight and another time opened a man&#x2019;s face from ear to mouth with a broken beer bottle. Stories about events Travis&#x2019;s daddy had witnessed before he&#x2019;d got right with the Lord. But Travis had heard other things. About how Carlton Toomey and his son were too lazy and hard-drinking to hold steady jobs. Travis&#x2019;s daddy claimed the Toomeys poached bears on national forest land. They cut off the paws and gutted out the gallbladders because folks in China paid good money to make potions from them. The Toomeys left the meat to rot, too sorry even to cut a few hams off the bears&#x2019; flanks. Anybody that trifling wouldn&#x2019;t bother walking the hundred yards between farmhouse and creek to watch for trespassers. Travis waded on upstream, going farther than he&#x2019;d ever been before. He caught more speckleds, and soon seven dollars&#x2019; worth bulged the back of his fishing vest. Enough money for gas and to help pay his insurance, and though it wasn&#x2019;t near the money he&#x2019;d been making at Pay-Lo bagging groceries, at least he could do this alone, not fussed at by some old hag of a store manager with nothing better to do than watch his every move, then fire him just because he was late a few times. He came to where the creek forked and it was there he saw a sudden high greening a few yards above him on the left. He stepped from the water and climbed the bank to make sure it was what he thought. The plants were staked like tomatoes and set in rows like tobacco or corn. They were worth money, a lot of money, because Travis knew how much his friend Shank paid for an ounce of good pot and this wasn&#x2019;t ounces but pounds. He heard something behind him and turned, ready to drop the rod and reel and make a run for it. On the other side of the creek a gray squirrel scrambled up the thick bark of a blackjack oak. Travis told himself there was no reason to get all feather-legged, that nobody would have seen him coming up the creek. He let his eyes scan what lay beyond the plants. A woodshed concealed the marijuana from anyone at the farmhouse or the dirt drive that petered out at the porch steps. Animal hides stalled mid-climb on the shed&#x2019;s graying boards. Coon and fox, in the center a bear, their limbs spread as though even in death they were still trying to escape. Nailed up there like a warning, Travis thought. He looked past the shed and didn&#x2019;t see anything moving, not even a cow or chicken. Nothing but some open ground and then a stand of tulip poplar. He rubbed a pot leaf between his finger and thumb, and it felt like money, a lot more money than he&#x2019;d ever make at a grocery store. He looked around one more time before taking out his pocketknife and cutting down five plants. The stalks had a twiney toughness like rope. That was the easy part. Dragging them a mile down the creek was a chore, especially while trying to keep the leaves and buds from being stripped off. When he got to the river he hid the marijuana in the underbrush and walked the trail to make sure no one was fishing. Then he carried the plants to the road edge, stashed them in the gully, and got the truck. When the last plants lay in the truck bed, he wiped his face with his hand. Blood and sweat wet his palm. Travis looked in the side mirror and saw a thin red line where mountain laurel had slapped his cheek. The cut made him look tougher, more dangerous, and he wished it had slashed him deeper, enough to leave a scar. He dumped his catch into the ditch, the trout stiff and glaze-eyed. He wouldn&#x2019;t be delivering Old Man Jenkins any speckleds this evening. Travis drove home with the plants hidden under willow branches and feed sacks. He planned to stay only long enough to get a shower and put on clean clothes, but as he was about to leave his father stopped him. &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t ate yet.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get something in town,&#x201d; Travis replied. &#x201c;No. Your momma&#x2019;s fixing supper right now, and she&#x2019;s got the table set for three.&#x201d; &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t got time. Shank&#x2019;s expecting me.&#x201d; &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll make time, boy,&#x201d; his father said. &#x201c;Else you and that truck can stay in for the evening.&#x201d; 2 it was six-thirty before travis turned into the abandoned Gulf station and parked window to window beside Shank&#x2019;s Plymouth Wildebeast. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t believe what I got in the back of this truck.&#x201d; Shank grinned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the old prune-faced bitch that fired you, is it?&#x201d; &#x201c;No, this here is worth something. Get out and I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d; They walked around to the truck bed and Shank peered in. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know there to be a big market for willow branches and feed sacks.&#x201d; Travis looked around to see if anyone was watching, then pulled back enough of a sack so Travis could see some leaves. &#x201c;I got five of them,&#x201d; Travis said. &#x201c;Holy shit. Where&#x2019;d that come from?&#x201d; &#x201c;Found it when I was fishing.&#x201d; Travis pulled the sack b...</p></p><h2>The House on First Street: My New Orleans Story</h2><p><p> After fifteen years of living like a vagabond on her reporter's schedule, Julia Reed got married and bought a house in the historic Garden District.

Differentiating between compliance, participation, motivation, and engagement, she shows how to develop and recognize true student engagement in your classroom and help students take more responsibility for their learning.</p> <p><strong>Explore the conditions where student-driven engagement flourishes.</strong> </p> <p>As a teacher, instructional coach, or principal you will learn to cultivate an environment for increasing student engagement. You will also explore four pillars of engagement that provide a framework for considering what it means to be engaged: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Intellectual urgency: </strong>The compelling drive we experience when we choose to invest time and effort in learning; using questions to propel our learning forward.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Emotional resonance:</strong> The ability to describe when a concept is imprinted on our mind and our heart; experiencing a strong emotional connection to what we learn or read.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Perspective bending: </strong>An awareness of how others' knowledge, emotions, and beliefs shape our own; adjusting our thinking when challenged and relishing the opportunity to impact others with our ideas.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The aesthetic world:</strong> A recognition of moments when we find something uniquely beautiful, captivating, hilarious, or meaningful; discussing a book, an illustration, a painting, or an idea that seems to have been created just for us.</li> </ul> <p> Truly engaged children are more likely to remember and reapply what they learn. Engagement provides authentic motivation for students and helps them become citizens who act on their learning for the betterment of the world.

His writings examine the complexities of decolonization for African subjectivities and the possibilities emerging in its wake. In <i>Out of the Great Darkness</i>, he offers a rich analysis of the paradoxes of the postcolonial moment that points toward new liberatory models of community and humanity.<br><br>In a nuanced consideration of the African experience, Mbembe makes sweeping interventions into debates about citizenship, identity, democracy, and modernity. He eruditely ranges across European and African thought to provide a powerful assessment of common ways of writing and thinking about Africa. Mbembe criticizes the blinders of European intellectuals, analyzing France&#x2019;s failure to heed postcolonial critiques of ongoing exclusions masked by pretenses of universalism. He develops a new reading of African modernity that further develops the notion of Afropolitanism, a novel way of being in the world that has arisen in decolonized Africa in the midst of both destruction and the birth of new societies, making the case for South Africa as its laboratory. <i>Out of the Great Darkness</i> reconstructs critical theory&#x2019;s historical and philosophical framework for understanding colonial and postcolonial events and expands our sense of the futures made possible by decolonization.</p><p><b>Achille Mbembe (Author) </b><br> Achille Mbembe is Professor of History and Political Science at Witwatersrand University, Johannesburg, South Africa, and the University of California, Irvine.

Many times these high-powered muscle cars were pursued by equally high-powered Dodge and Plymouth police cars that were also packing Mopar big-block power under the hood. In 1978, the last of the Mopar big-blocks rolled down the production line, but in an odd twist of fate, the popularity of the Mopar surged again in street and strip cars during the 1980s. By the 1990s, the big Mopar engine was more popular than ever. </p><p>This book covers how to build Mopar's 383-, 400-, 413-, 426-, and 440-ci engines to power levels of 600 to 900 hp. <i>How to Build Max-Performance Mopar Big Blocks</i> discusses how to properly budget your engine build for a specific performance target and how to select a stock or aftermarket block for the desired performance level. The reciprocating assembly (crankshaft, connecting rods, and pistons) is examined in detail, to help you select the right design and material for durability and performance requirements. Cylinder heads and valvetrain configurations are crucial for generating maximum horsepower and torque. This volume discusses all the stock modification options, the best setups, selecting the right machine work, the latest aftermarket head options for producing huge horsepower, and building stroker engines. The camshafts and lifters chapter compares and contrasts use of hydraulic flat tappet, hydraulic roller, and solid flat tappet cams. In addition, the book explains how to optimize fresh and spent fuel, discussing single- and dual-plane intake manifolds, as well as the exhaust-system design to optimize scavenging. Also details engine builds at 600, 700, 800, and 900 horsepower levels to provide insight and reveal what can be done with real-world component packages.</p></p><p>A veteran magazine writer/photographer, Andy Finkbeiner has created scores of articles for Popular Hot Rodding, Mopar Action, and Mopar Muscle. Finkbeiner bought his first Mopar, a 1965 Dodge Coronet, while in college. That Coronet came with a 426W engine that started the author on the path of many big-block projects. Finkbeiner lives with his wife and two kids in Wilsonville, Oregon. He owns AR Engineering, which is a company devoted to the design and manufacturing of parts for muscle car era Mopars.No matter what level you are thinking about, this book will help you make correct choices. -----Performance in Motion, Summer 2009<br><br>The book also has the advantage of being up to date, which is especially helpful in, for example the intake manifold chapter, where Finkbeiner is able to compare the most current aftermarket offerings.

You want to tie up pain in a pretty little package and hide it under the bed, taking it out only when you feel strong enough to face it. But grief won&#x2019;t be contained. Grief disobeys. Grief explodes. In one breath, you may be able to say that God&#x2019;s got this and all will be well. In the next, you might descend into fatalism. No pretending. Here, you are raw before God, an open wound.<br><br>There is a pathway through this suffering. It&#x2019;s not easy, but God will use it to lead you toward healing. This path is called lament.

Lean into these pages and you&#x2019;ll hear the beauty of the Louder Song&#x2015;that your soul is desperately longing to hear. (Ann Voskamp, NYT bestselling author of The Broken Way)<br><br>There&#x2019;s no denying we live in a fallen, broken, and sinful world&#x2015;a world of pain&#x2015;where suffering is a reality for all of us at various levels. Aubrey Sampson peels away the layers of pretense that often masquerade as outward strength or valor as she unpacks an expressive theology of lament. Anchored by her own faith journey and experience of personal loss and suffering, Aubrey encourages authenticity and fosters hope for those who are in the midst of pain and suffering. I am confident this book will be of great encouragement to you as you reflect on the experiences of lament in a world of suffering.

One certain outcome: You will never look at snow globes the same way again.

Anchored in Scripture and enlivened by storytelling, this powerful book makes something lyrical of lament. And I suppose this, too, is a mystery&#x2015;that the most beautiful songs are often born out of suffering. <i>The Louder Song</i> will be a pleasure to recommend and reread. (Jen Michel, author of Surprised by Paradox)<br><br>This is a beautiful book. It is real about lament and honest about suffering, but not without hope. With reflections on lament that are both deeply personal and guided by Scripture, <i>The Louder Song</i> composes a harmonious tune that will be restorative music to the ears of anyone who has felt isolated, unknown, or hopeless in their pain. Emily Dickinson once wrote, &#x201c;&#x2018;Hope&#x2019; is the thing with feathers&#x2015; / That perches in the soul&#x2015; / And sings the tune without the words&#x2015; / And never stops&#x2015;at all&#x2015;.&#x201d; The buoyancy of enduring, Christ-filled, soul-stirring hope, even in the midst of pain, comes through in Aubrey Sampson&#x2019;s transparent and evocative writing.

Aubrey&#x2019;s story is a personal lesson in how to pass through disappointment and pain without getting stuck there. (Christine Caine, bestselling author and founder of The A21 Campaign and Propel Women)<br><br><i>The Louder Song: Listening for Hope in the Midst of Lament</i> is a rare book written with honest, raw emotion about experiencing life&#x2019;s most challenging times. Aubrey Sampson uses stories from her life and Scripture to remind us it&#x2019;s okay to cry out to God when we don&#x2019;t understand. If you&#x2019;re going through a challenging time right now or trying to help someone who is, this book is for you! (Dave Ferguson, lead pastor at Community Christian Church)<br><br>Having walked through suffering in my own life and with others, I know how tempting it can be to skip right past the hard stuff&#x2015;and how much we miss out on if we do. In this book, Aubrey Sampson perfectly articulates the beauty of lament and offers it as a gift to anyone who has ever cried out to God&#x2015;and to the church&#x2015;in their pain. Through her own story and keen insights, she helps readers learn how to walk through grief while remaining anchored in hope. (Jamie D.

(Catherine McNiel, author of Long Days of Small Things)<br><br>A book written from the mind reaches a mind; a book written from the heart reaches a heart; and a book written from a life reaches a life. This book is a life reacher. Aubrey invites us to hold the suffering of life and the sovereignty of God together with both hands. (Tricia Lott Williford, author of And Life Comes Back and You Can Do This)<br><br>What does a person who believes in a good and powerful God do with unimaginable pain . . . and seemingly stone-cold silence from heaven? Aubrey Sampson, from Scripture and experience, says we must lament. Not to find answers, but to &#x201c;be still in the unanswerable.&#x201d; Not to force God&#x2019;s hand, but to be intimately &#x201c;tethered to his presence.&#x201d; <i>The Louder Song</i> gives hope that in the midst of life-shattering wounds, God sees us and invites us to cry out&#x2015;raw and real&#x2015;to him. In response, he comes close, walking with us through our pain, until the day when pain is no more. A must-read!

There he would hang for the rest of the riot During those hours of madness that were to follow, inmates would come in and hack at his dangling corpse with knives, beat it with pipes, mutilating it so totally that it was beyond recognition, a raw, bloody mass of flesh, by the time the uprising was over.&#34;The Hate Factory</p><p>G.

This little tome can hardly reverse that, but it is meant as an exercise in reading the Old Testament for fun and profit. As my mother-in-law used to say, 'It's different anyway.' And maybe it will help. Most of what I do in the following pages involves discussing examples of Old Testament narratives. I have tried to select examples from a broad range of possibilities. By the way, I assume that you have the biblical text handy in order to carry on your 'Berean' work." <i>Dale Ralph Davis</i></p></p><p>Dale Ralph Davis is Minister in Residence, First Presbyterian Church, Columbia, South Carolina. Prior to that he was pastor of Woodland Presbyterian Church, Hattiesburg, Mississippi and Professor of Old Testament at Reformed Theological Seminary, Jackson, Mississippi.I think Davis succeeds admirably in his goal. I found myself stirred up reading the book. He writes well and shows how, even though there are difficult and confusing parts of Scripture, it is not that difficult to find key truths. This is a very encouraging and helpful book. (Ray Van Neste ~ Director, R. C. Ryan Center for Biblical Studies, Union University, Jackson, Tennessee)<br><br>"Davis maintains that avoidance of difficult texts &#x2018;gets us and nowhere and impoverishes the church'. His excellent chapter on appropriation/application includes the damming sentence: &#x2018; I hold a reader who does not appropriate and/or a teacher who will not apply Scripture is practising abortion on the Bible' You may or may not want to imitate Davis Style but if you read this book you will want to lift his structures and insights straight off the page. And that is no bad thing for the church." (Ann Benton ~ Author and family conference speaker, Guildford, England)<br><br>"There is no more gifted expositor of the Old Testament in our day than Ralph Davis. His book not only brings scholarly research to bear on the subject, but also reflects his many years of preaching week after week through the Old Testament. What a gift to the church to have such a fine book." (Richard Pratt ~ President, Third Millennium Ministries, Orlando, Florida)<br><br>This is vintage Dale Ralph Davis - accessible and practical scholarship in a readable and stimulating Style. The Subtitle of the book is 'How to preach from Old Testament narrative and that's exactly what Davis describes. With many examples, and that's exactly what Davis describes. With many examples, and interesting illustrations, he teaches us how to grapple honestly with what sometimes can be intimidating, difficult and uncomfortable portions of Scripture. (Evangelical Times)<br><br>"Dale Ralph Davis has written a wonderfully straightforward, readable book entitled, <i> The Word Became Fresh: How to Preach from Old Testament Narrative Texts</i> (Christian Focus; pb., 154 pp.). Davis, like Goldsworthy, laments how complicated we have sometimes made biblical interpretation and instead outlines a basic approach to careful, sensible reading which opens up the theology of Old Testament narratives. This is one of those books that makes you want to preach after reading it!" (Preaching.com Bible and Bible Survey Review 2007)<br><br>"With many examples, and that's exactly what Davis describes.

In this definitive, official authorized biography, authors David Leaf and Ken Sharp were given full, unprecedented access to Kiss and their inner circle. Hear the true, uncensored stories from Gene Simmons, the fire-breathing Demon; Paul Stanley, the acrobatic Starchild; Ace Frehley, the axe-slinging Spaceman; and Peter Criss, the levitating Catman drummer. Chronicling the group&#39;s amazing story, this one-of-a-kind book also offers interviews with some of the biggest stars in rock music, including Pete Townshend, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, Ozzy Osbourne, and many others. The only book that truly captures the inimitable and exuberant spirit of the fiery foursome who gave America its second national anthem, &#34;Rock and Roll All Nite,&#34; Kiss: Behind the Mask is a must-have for the band&#39;s legion of Kiss Army acolytes. * Dozens of never-before-seen photos * The band&#39;s story, told in their own words * Exclusive album-by-album, song-by-song commentary * In unique interviews, today&#39;s rock superstars tell why they love Kiss.</p><p>Ken Sharp has been writing articles about KISS for nearly three decades in such publications as Goldmine. He has also worked as a writer/researcher for music programs on the cable network VH1.<br>David Leaf is a rock journalist who has written biographies of the BeeGees and the Beach Boys, among others.<br>With its combination of cartoonish monster-movie makeup and oversized costumes, ear-splitting amplification and gleeful songs in praise of sex, heavy metal rock legend Kiss has never been accused of not being excessive, and this book is a great example of why it is still a multimillion-dollar profit-making machine. While this book covers much of the same biographical territory as Gene Simmons's Kiss and Make-Up and Kisstory (the band's self-published 440-page coffee-table-sized tome), the authorized bio presents more than enough new material to make it essential for hardcore fans. Much of the book's first half presents a previously unpublished work based on the only in-depth interviews the band gave in 1980. The result is a remarkably humanizing look behind the heavy metal tomfoolery, with Simmons more honestly discussing his Jewish upbringing than he does in his autobiography, and the rest of the band disarmingly admitting to borrowing from the glam-rocker New York Dolls as well as the Harlem Globetrotters. The book's second half, however, is the true highlight for Kiss fans: a comprehensive look at all of the Kiss albums ever made. Among the surprises is the praise of noted producer Eddie Kramer, a close associate of Jimi Hendrix, for the band's no-nonsense work ethic. Of note are Kiss's hilariously guileless quotes, such as the admission that another producer "made a point of trying to get us to stop writing songs about getting laid, which was valid. But he needed to understand that's all we ever did."<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility: Biblical Perspective in Tension</h2><p>Both theology and philosophy wrestle with the tension that exists between the sovereignty of God and human response. In Christianity, this tension is particularly acute as God is understood to be both omnipotent and benevolent. This tension underlies numerous other questions: about the nature of God, the meaning of human freedom and choice, the concept of divine repentance, the reign of God and supremely, the significance of the incarnation. Dr. Carson brings clear, scholarly insights and finely-honed exegetical skills to this all-pervasive issue, seeing it not so much as a problem to be solved as a framework to be explored. He examines the sovereignty-responsibility themes in the Old Testament, intertestamental literature and in the theology of John&#39;s gospel and concludes with a reflection on the theological implications for ministry and mission today.</p><p>D. A. Carson is Professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois. He is the author or editor of more than forty books, including From Sabbath to Lord&#39;s Day, The Sermon on the Mount, Exegetical Fallacies, Matthew (EBC), Showing the Spirit, How Long, O Lord?

I learned about Frank Lloyd wright in the early 90&#39;s when I had to do research on his style in order to design lamp- shades for my employer. I was really taken by his &#34;prairie style&#34; of design and felt a connection to my own work. Making the designs for this book was a joy because I really like this style of design.Alex Spatz grew up in the midwest and got involved with stained glass through a college course while studying for a B.F.A. degree in studio art. This led to a job designing decorative mirrors and a start in the decorative accessories industry. Throughout his career he has designed glass and mirror products as well as stained glass windows, lampshades and gift items for nationally distributed companies.

Not true.</p> <p>My first discovery was that DuBose was a high school dropout and that Dorothy, a young orphan, was unusually well educated and already an award winning playwright when they married. Then I discovered the huge economic disparities between them. Dorothy was wealthy and although DuBose was comfortable at the time they met, he had grown up in poverty. I ran across a copy of her birth certificate, on which her name is &#x201c;Dorothea&#x201d;&#x2014;my name&#x2014;and letterhead that stated she lived on Fifth and Twelfth in Manhattan&#x2014;my old address&#x2014; on and on. Every time I turned around, it seemed I was bumping into another coincidence. Okay, I thought, there&#x2019;s a story here and I&#x2019;m going to try and tell it. Who was <em>Dorothy</em> Heyward? And what happened that summer on Folly Beach?</p> <p>It is historic fact that Dorothy herself adapted DuBose&#x2019;s book <em>Porgy</em> for the stage and that she also had a great hand in creating the adaptation of <em>Mamba&#x2019;s Daughters</em> for the stage, the two most successful works with DuBose Heyward&#x2019;s name attached to them. But she shied away from taking credit for herself and spent her widowhood making sure that DuBose&#x2019;s name appeared in the credits of all of Gershwin&#x2019;s productions of <em>Porgy and Bess</em> so that his estate would receive the royalties that were due.</p> <p>What is in those boxes at the SCHS is there because it was what Dorothy wanted us to see. Every single letter from her to DuBose is absent. Perhaps he did not save her letters or perhaps she disposed of them. We will never know. But it appears that Dorothy wanted us to have a one-sided conversation with DuBose, not her. Dorothy always wanted DuBose to be the celebrity, the icon, the one who was remembered and revered. She loved him that much.</p> <p>And, finally, while Dorothy Heyward may have wanted to disappear into history as &#x201c;just a girl from Ohio who wanted a career on the other side of the footlights,&#x201d; the facts appear differently to me. True, she was diminutive in the extreme, and the fact that she was from Ohio may have left her more easily dismissed by DuBose&#x2019;s crowd of aristocratic old Charlestonians. But Dorothy Kuhns Heyward was a powerhouse, who married into one of Charleston&#x2019;s most prestigious families and spent her life doing everything she could for the man she fiercely loved who was, for his time, a civil rights pioneer. My new novel explores their lifelong collaboration, their devotion to each other and what magic happened on Folly Beach in 1934 and in 2010, both periods of fascinating self-discovery.</p><p>Folly Beach, South Carolina, with its glistening beaches, laid-back Southern charm, and enticing Gullah tradition, is the land of Cate Cooper&#x2019;s childhood, the place where all the ghosts of her past roam freely.

An understanding of all these factors, and of psychopharmacology, can lead to better treatment decisions. <p>This book is for many readers: for psychiatrists who recognize the daily challenges in treating patients; for primary care physicians who identify psychiatric disorders in their patients; for non-medically-trained mental health professionals who want a more sophisticated understanding of psychopharmacology; and even for patients who want and need a better understanding of the medications their doctors have prescribed them.</p></p><p>Stephen V.

McClellan III and Harold Dorn&#x2019;s bestselling book argues that technology as "applied science" emerged relatively recently, as industry and governments began funding scientific research that would lead directly to new or improved technologies.</p><p>McClellan and Dorn identify two great scientific traditions: the useful sciences, which societies patronized from time immemorial, and the exploration of questions about nature itself, which the ancient Greeks originated. The authors examine scientific traditions that took root in China, India, and Central and South America, as well as in a series of Near Eastern empires in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. From this comparative perspective, McClellan and Dorn survey the rise of the West, the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century, the Industrial Revolution, and the modern marriage of science and technology. They trace the development of world science and technology today while raising provocative questions about the sustainability of industrial civilization.</p><p>This new edition of <i>Science and Technology in World History </i>offers an enlarged thematic introduction and significantly extends its treatment of industrial civilization and the technological supersystem built on the modern electrical grid. The Internet and social media receive increased attention. Facts and figures have been thoroughly updated and the work includes a comprehensive Guide to Resources, incorporating the major published literature along with a vetted list of websites and Internet resources for students and lay readers.</p></p><p><p>Arguably the best general history of science and technology ever published.</p><p><b>James E.

Although the authors came from different backgrounds, there is one message, one theme, one thread that runs throughout the entire Bible from the first book, Genesis, to the last book, Revelation. That message is God&#x2019;s redeeming love for mankind&#x2014;a message that is as relevant for us today as it was two thousand years ago.The Poetical Books reveal the heart of the nation of Israel and are considered some of the finest literature ever written. It is as if the authors&#x2019; very hearts have been opened up for all to see. Pain is not minimized, nor is man&#x2019;s struggle to understand God downplayed. Questions of suffering are boldly asked, worship is gloriously displayed, wisdom is held in highest esteem, married sexual love is unashamedly portrayed, and philosophy is openly debated.Hebrew poetry is not structured around the rhyme or meter we are used to reading and hearing. Instead, ideas are often stated in one line and then reinforced in the second line, or a second line is composed to add to or complete the thoughts of the first. In other forms, the second line of poetry contrasts the first.Job and Song of Solomon were written as dramatic poems that tell a story. Most of the psalms were written to be accompanied by an instrument and are thus examples of lyric poetry&#x2014;rich in its language of worship and praise. Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are examples of didactic poetry, giving instructions or lessons about life in short conciseverses.</p><p>God&#x2019;s Amazing Word. Learn it. Live it. Have it for Life.

Remini's prize-winning, three-volume biography Life of Andrew Jackson won the National Book Award on its completion in 1984 and is recognized as one of the greatest lives of a U.S. President. In this meticulously crafted single-volume abridgment, Remini captures the essence of the life and career of the seventh president of the United States. As president, from 1829-1837, Jackson was a significant force in the nations's expansion, the growth of presidential power, and the transition from republicanism to democracy. </p><p> Jackson is a highly controversial figure who is undergoing historical reconsideration today. He is known as spurring the emergence of the modern American political division of Republican and Democractic parties, for the infamous Indian removal on the Trail of Tears, and for his brave victory against the British as Major General at the Battle of New Orleans.</p><p> Never an apologist, Remini portrays Jackson as a foreceful, sometimes tragic, hero--a man whose strength and flaws were larger than life, a president whose conviction provided the nation with one of the most influential, colorful, and controversial administrations in our history.</p><p>Robert V. Remini is professor of history emeritus and research professor of humanities emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago and historian of the United States House of Representatives.

When he learns the ways he's contracted and spread the malady, he begins proper hygiene and recovers, as do his victims, until another child with a runny nose enters the classroom. Readers who relish the gross humor at the beginning may balk at the didactic climax and resolution. The author's big-head Photoshop cartoons reveal his background in television animation. This style is also evident in the all-round hyperbole. Mucus gushes from noses, Simon vomits out of the school bus window, and a giant protozoa brags about his gift of diarrhea.

In little Union Grove in upstate New York, the townspeople are preparing for Christmas. Without the consumerist shopping frenzy that dogged the holidays of the previous age, the season has become a time to focus on family and loved ones. It is a stormy Christmas Eve when Robert Earle&#x2019;s son Daniel arrives back from his two years of sojourning throughout what is left of the United States. He collapses from exhaustion and illness, but as he recovers tells the story of the break-up of the nation into three uneasy independent regions and his journey into the dark heart of the New Foxfire Republic centered in Tennesee and led by the female evangelical despot, Loving Morrow. In the background, Union Grove has been shocked by the Christmas Eve double murder by a young mother, in the throes of illness, of her husband and infant son. Town magistrate Stephen Bullock is in a hanging mood.<br><br><i>A History of the Future</i> is attention-grabbing and provocative, but also lyrical, tender, and comic a vision of a future of America that is becoming more and more convincing and perhaps even desirable with each passing day.</p><p>James Howard Kunstler was born in New York City in 1948. He is the author of twelve novels, including "World Made By Hand" and "The Witch of Hebron," and four nonfiction books, including "The Long Emergency." He is a frequent lecturer at colleges and professional organizations across the country. He lives in Saratoga Springs, New York.<br>Advance Praise for <i>A History of the Future</i>:<br><br>Kunstler&#x2019;s post-economic-collapse and postdigital World Made by Hand series continues with increasing literary finesse in the third installment. . . . Kunstler, who overtly articulates his postoil vision in his nonfiction revels in this back-to-basics way of life. . . . Kunstler skewers everything from kitsch to greed, prejudice, bloodshed, and brainwashing in this wily, funny, rip-roaring, and profoundly provocative pageturner, leaving no doubt that the prescriptive yet devilishly satiric World Made by Hand series will continue." <b><i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</b><br><br> The arrival of this latest addition to James Howard Kunstler&#x2019;s post-apocalyptic World Made by Hand&#x201d; series reminds me that time is running out for me to get started reading these books . . . After all, the world could collapse any minute as it does in these novels.&#x201d; <b>The Quivering Pen</b><br><br> After reading the novel you will come away with an appreciation for self-sufficiency . . . I&#x2019;d recommend it to anyone who wants a realistic picture into the not too distant future.&#x201d; <b>TheBurningPlatform.com</b><br><br>Praise for the <i>World Made by Hand</i> series:<br><br> Far from a typical postapocalyptic novel. It caters neither to a pseudo-morbid nor faddishly slick vision of the future. Though grim with portent, it is ultimately, as Camus&#x2019;s novel <i>The Plague</i>, an impassioned and invigorating tale whose ultimate message is one of hope, not despair.&#x201d; <b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> on <i>World Made by Hand</i></b><br><br> The verisimilitude of Kunstler&#x2019;s world leads me to think the future is Union Grove. Thirty years from now, it will be interesting to see if that little town seems excessively sad, richly luxurious or spot on. But for now, I&#x2019;m hedging my bets. Where I Live, one block east of ground zero, I&#x2019;ve started keeping a compost bin and am thinking about adding a micro wind generator. Two blocks south, the damaged former Deutsche Bank building comes down floor by floor. To the north, the Freedom Tower has just emerged aboveground and may one day be full of investment bankers. Recently, though, I&#x2019;ve started looking at that plot through Kunstler&#x2019;s eyes. It gets good sunlight, and it occurs to me it would make a hell of a bean field.&#x201d; <b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i> on <i>World Made by Hand</i></b><br><br> Chronicles the aftereffects of the collapse of our technological society in the near future . . . Kunstler&#x2019;s storytelling talents are in evidence here. Kunstler has punctuated the nightmarish scenario of his novel with . . . poignant moments where hope and despair vie for dominance of the human spirit.&#x201d; <b><i>The Seattle Times</i> on <i>World Made by Hand</i></b><br><br> In many ways [The Witch of Hebron] reminded me of Larry McMurty&#x2019;s <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, set in the dystopian world of <i>The Road</i>. . . . By the middle of the book you are immersed in a richly imagined world made by hand,&#x2019; eagerly devouring every page. . . . [Kunstler] has woven his nightmares into a vision or America after a complete economic, political, and cultural collapse.&#x201d; <b><i>New York Journal of Books</i> on <i>The Witch of Hebron</i></b><br><br> Kunstler offers a sharply cautionary tale, conjuring up bizarre characters who would be right at home in the scariest haunted houses. . . . Kunstler excels at writing lyric passages about nature . . . His acute pessimism about the future coexists with his faith in the human instinct to survive and adapt . . . [and] he demonstrates that the human penchant for storytelling is unlikely ever to become extinct so long as a single human being has breath enough to speak and strength enough to write.&#x201d; <b><i>America Magazine</i> on <i>The Witch of Hebron</i></b><br><br>"What's after Armageddon? No government, no laws, no infrastructure, no oil, no industry....and sometimes a sense of relief. In James Howard Kunstler's richly imagined World Made by Hand, the bone-weary denizens of Union Grove (with its echo of Our Town's Grover's Corners) cope with everything from mercenary thugs to religious extremists, yet manage to plant a few seeds of human decency that bear fruit." <b><i> O Magazine</i> on <i>World Made by Hand</i></b><br><br> One pitfall in painting a convincing picture of the future is forgetting all the small ways in which life would differ if big changes swept in. Kunstler avoids it, and his catalog of such finer points is a subtle, continuing pleasure.&#x201d; <b><i>The Boston Globe</i> on <i>World Made by Hand</i></b><br></p><h2>Word Games for Clever Kids (Buster Brain Games)</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

More at LargePrintLiberty.com.<br> <br> Some great books are the product of a lifetime of research, reflection, and labored discipline. But other classics are written in a white heat during the moment of discovery, with prose that shines forth like the sun pouring into the window of a time when a new understanding brings in the world into focus for the first time.<br> <br> "The Market for Liberty" is that second type of classic, and what a treasure it is. Written by two authors-Morris and Linda Tannehill-just following a period of intense study of the writings of both Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard, it has the pace, energy, and rigor you would expect from an evening's discussion with either of these two giants.<br> <br> More than that, these authors put pen to paper at precisely the right time in their intellectual development, that period rhapsodic freshness when a great truth had been revealed, and they had to share it with the world. Clearly, the authors fell in love with liberty and the free market, and wrote an engaging, book-length sonnet to these ideas.<br> <br> This book is very radical in the true sense of that term: it gets to the root of the problem of government and provides a rethinking of the whole organization of society. They start at the beginning with the idea of the individual and his rights, work their way through exchange and the market, expose government as the great enemy of mankind, and then-and here is the great surprise-they offer a dramatic expansion of market logic into areas of security and defense provision.<br> <br> Their discussion of this controversial topic is integrated into their libertarian theoretical apparatus. It deals with private arbitration agencies in managing with disputes and criminality, the role of insurers in providing profitable incentives for security, and private agencies in their capacity as protection services. It's for this reason that Hoppe calls this book an "outstanding yet much neglected analysis of the operation of competition."</p><p>Excerpted from the Foreword by Karl Hess.

Although they are kind to him, they are mainly interested in having cheap labor.</p><p>Joan Lowery Nixon was the author of more than 130 books for young readers and was the only four-time winner of the Edgar Allan Poe Best Young Adult Mystery Award. She received the award for&nbsp;<i>The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore</i>,&nbsp;<i>The S�ance</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Name of the Game Was Murder</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Other Side of the Dark</i>, which also won the California Young Reader Medal. Her historical fiction included the award-winning series The Orphan Train Adventures, Orphan Train Children, and Colonial Williamsburg: Young Americans.Grade 4-6 This is Nixon's second book that chronicles the adventures of six Irish-American siblings who have been sent from the slums of New York City to new homes on the Frontier in the years just prior to the Civil War. The focus here is on 11-year-old Mike Kel ley, who is placed with a German immi grant farmer more interested in acquir ing cheap labor than a new family member. When Mike overhears Frie drich and his kind-hearted wife discuss ing their fear of retribution over a man's death, he suspects foul play. The imagi native youngster's suspicions are ag gravated when his best friend Reuben, an educated farmhand, disappears after a loud altercation with the overseer. The puzzle is believably pieced togeth er as the motivations of father and son are revealed at story's end. Unfortu nately, this revelation does little to ex tend the dimension of these two flat characters who approach ethnic stereo types. The industry and discipline re quired by agrarians of the period, along with their isolation (an element which contributes to the book's suspenseful, at times melodramatic, tone), is ade quately conveyed. On the other hand, information about slavery and immigra tion is presented in a contrived manner. Flaws outweigh attributes. Events re ferred to which occured in the first in stallment are unclear, plot threads are unresolved, and the dialogue is weak. In the final analysis, this is more of a suspense novel with a historical setting than a solid historical novel with a sus penseful storyline.Julie Corsaro, Univ. of Chicago Laboratory Schools<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Girl, Arise!: A Catholic Feminist&#39;s Invitation to Live Boldly, Love Your Faith, and Change the World</h2><p><p>Is it possible to be both a Catholic and a feminist? Claire Swinarski, writer and creator of <i>The Catholic Feminist</i> podcast, believes it is: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a feminist for the same reason I&#x2019;m bold and honest and sometimes ragey: because Jesus was all of those things.&#x201d;</p><p>In <i>Girl, Arise!</i>, Swinarski reconciles the two identities by demonstrating the strength and abilities women have to share with the Body of Christ, the importance of women throughout the history of the faith, and how the love you experience through Christ and the Church can change you and the world around you.</p><p>In <i>Girl, Arise!:</i><i>A Catholic Feminist&#x2019;s Invitation to Live Boldly, Love Your Faith, and Change the World </i>Swinarski points out that while both &#x201c;feminism&#x201d; and &#x201c;Catholicism&#x201d; can mean different things to different people, both feminists and Catholics desire to make the world a better, fairer place. And she shows that by treating women with dignity equal to that of men&#x2014;by calling them his friends and teaching them&#x2014;Jesus acted as a feminist as well.</p><p>With humor and sass, Swinarski addresses her frustration with the traditional concerns churches ascribe to women, as shown by the many talks directed at women focused on marriage and modesty rather than social justice. But she pinpoints the areas where modern feminism goes too far, arguing against abortion and exploring what it means to serve others rather than focus on our own needs first.</p><p>Swinarski also tells the stories of holy women&#x2014;including Vashti in the book of Esther, Sts.

Altschuler, <i>Florida</i> <i>Courier</i>).<br><br>As the crack epidemic swept across inner-city America in the early 1980s, the streets of Baltimore were crime ridden. For poor kids from the housing projects, the future looked bleak. But basketball could provide the quickest ticket out, an opportunity to earn a college scholarship and perhaps even play in the NBA.<br> <br>Dunbar High School had one of the most successful basketball programs in the country; in the early 1980s, the Dunbar Poets were arguably the best high school team of all time. Four starting players&#x2014;Muggsy Bogues, Reggie Williams, David Wingate, and Reggie Lewis&#x2014;would eventually play in the NBA, an unheard-of success rate. In <i>The Boys of Dunbar</i>, Alejandro Danois revisits the 1981-1982 season with the Poets as the team conquered all its opponents. But more than that, he takes us into the lives of these kids, and especially of Coach Bob Wade, a former NFL player from the same neighborhood who knew that the basketball court, and the lessons his players would learn there, held the key to the future.<br> <br>&#x201c;[Danois&#x2019;] tale of the basketball exploits of a handful of high school students in the 1980s shows young men motivated by their coach and other recreation leaders to dream beyond the hardship of their geography&#x201d; (Bijan C.

They were the chosen ones, the few who had actually realized the dream this early in their lives. Through every summer tournament, winter recreation league game, and one-on-one contest, through every solitary morning sidestepping broken glass and empty liquor bottles, dribbling a ball through imaginary defenders to practice jump shots or master the backboard, the boys&#x2019; goal was the same. Not the NCAA, not the NBA, but suiting up for the only franchise that mattered to them, Dunbar.<br> <br>They yearned to hold aloft the flame of Dunbar basketball excellence. Whatever their drill sergeant of a coach demanded of them, they demanded of one another. The Dunbar tradition was a major source of pride to a large swath of the city of Baltimore. This fact was not lost on any of them.<br> <br>The imposing edifice of Dunbar High School was stuffed tightly amid dreary housing projects and sagging row homes in predominantly black East Baltimore. For all of the drab building&#x2019;s shortcomings, the gymnasium inside was a veritable shrine, a sacrosanct place to the young men now standing on its hardwood floor. Despite their weary muscles, the boys were anxious to get their season under way.<br> <br>For head coach Bob Wade, who was also Dunbar&#x2019;s head varsity football and baseball coach, and returning players like junior All-American Reggie Williams and highly recruited seniors David Wingate and Gary Graham, the disappointment of the previous season&#x2019;s 94&#x2013;91 triple-overtime loss to Calvert Hall, a Catholic school, remained fresh in their minds. It was a contest that many thought was one of the greatest high school games ever played between two Baltimore area schools.<br> <br>Despite the months that had passed and the fresh start that a new season promised, that loss inspired Dunbar from the first whistle of that initial practice. Wade was entering the season with a mind-boggling record of 132&#x2013;10 as Dunbar&#x2019;s head coach, having won five Maryland Scholastic Association titles over the previous six years. But there were many people in the city who questioned his success and the tactics he employed to achieve such a sparkling r�sum�. There were whispers from parents and coaches at other city schools intimating that Wade recruited his players.<br> <br>Three of his team&#x2019;s new starters had transferred from other schools at the beginning of the &#x2019;81&#x2013;&#x2019;82 school year. Some people wanted an investigation and sanctions, referring to Dunbar as &#x201c;the city All-Stars.&#x201d; But the truth, as difficult as it was for some to accept, was that Wade did not need to recruit. Dunbar was the city&#x2019;s marquee public school program, with an astounding talent pool that resided in the surrounding housing projects. Almost every talented kid in the city wanted to play there.<br> <br>&#x201c;I never recruited a player, nor did I have to,&#x201d; said Wade. &#x201c;Dunbar had a tradition of excellence that many kids dreamed of being a part of. That tradition was established long before I ever got there. I was just lucky enough that so many talented kids wanted to be a part of what we were doing.&#x201d; Wade may not have &#x201c;recruited&#x201d; players, but he certainly singled out those youngsters he believed showed the most promise, regardless of their neighborhood or school district.<br> <br>The Poets had lost three games the year before. Wade was more determined than ever that this new squad was going to do better. His challenge every year was to find which buttons to push with certain players; who could accept being yelled at and who needed quiet encouragement. At various points in practice, he joked, he cajoled, and sometimes he yelled and insulted. One minute, he&#x2019;d appear surly, brusque, and dyspeptic, the next solicitous and benevolent. With the talent at his disposal, he drove them mercilessly, determined to make practices so difficult that every game, no matter who they faced, would be a cakewalk. In his eyes, the three losses that they had suffered the year before were three too many.<br> <br>Wade emphasized the game&#x2019;s details, the subtle nuances that many high school kids never learn to master. His practices were filled with hours upon hours of drills that fostered a mastery of things like defensive footwork, swift defensive rotations designed to keep players between the opposing man and the basket, how to take charges, how to set screens, the proper angles to take when rolling off the screen and cutting to the basket, how to box out for rebounds, and how to throw outlet passes, among a plethora of other details that could be the difference between a win or a loss in a close game. Wade ran the same drills over and over again, programming his players to react quickly and correctly to various game situations. The casual fans who packed Dunbar&#x2019;s gym and didn&#x2019;t have an advanced understanding of the game undoubtedly enjoyed the frenetic pace that the Poets played at, the alley-oops, the slam dunks, and the way they ran the ball down an opponent&#x2019;s throat. They might have assumed that his players were just great athletes and that all Wade had to do was roll the ball out and let them run up and down the court. But sophisticated students of the game could see the discipline, how fundamentally sound and unselfish his Dunbar teams were, how they&#x2019;d coalesced as a unit, always seeming to make the right plays by instantaneously adjusting.<br> <br>Wade&#x2019;s other obsession was academics. From the mandatory study halls that were required for his players year-round, even when their sport was out of season, to the teachers he convinced to give up a slice of their free time to volunteer as tutors, Wade&#x2019;s commitment to his athletes&#x2019; classroom responsibilities was unquestioned. If a star player needed help, Wade had a support infrastructure in place. He&#x2019;d make sure his kids worked in the classroom because he knew that one day the balls would stop bouncing. If a star player failed, there were no special provisions or demands on teachers to let his boys slide by for the sake of athletic victories. If they couldn&#x2019;t handle their responsibilities in school, they simply couldn&#x2019;t play for him.<br> <br>Wade also had another mechanism in place that allowed him to keep tabs on his players outside of the school: the neighborhood grapevine. He&#x2019;d walked the same streets during his youth, knew the neighborhood inside and out, and had a network of informants, from law enforcement personnel like his good friend Marshall Goodwin, who worked as an officer with the city&#x2019;s sheriff&#x2019;s department and served as the team&#x2019;s de facto bodyguard, to folks involved in the less desirable elements of the underground economy. Having grown up in the area, he was well respected, even by the criminal element. Despite their illegal activities, even the drug dealers operated by a tacit code in East Baltimore: Bob Wade&#x2019;s Dunbar Poets were off-limits.<br> <br>But the city&#x2019;s drug trade was metastasizing into something far more malignant; its victims were being snared at an earlier age than ever before. When Wade was a teenager, the heroin trade, with its scarce supply and great demand, was run by old-school traffickers whose inventories were, in effect, &#x201c;regulated.&#x201d; These were people who saw themselves as businessmen, who kept their circles small. It was a matter of ethics for them to keep the trade away from the street corners and the neighborhood children. Their drugs were processed in safe houses and later distributed through bars, pool halls, and nightclubs, or delivered to individual customers in their apartments or private homes. They had a conservative, long-term approach to their business philosophies.<br> <br>The old-school kingpins had enduring links to small local businesses through legitimate investments and loans, where they effectively washed their money. They nurtured community support by giving away Thanksgiving meals to needy families, purchasing and having groceries delivered to the elderly, sponsoring bus trips to local amusement parks and neighborhood block parties and picnics. But the demarcation of keeping kids away from the narcotics trade was crossed in the late 1970s when a new breed of kingpin emerged and changed the business model in favor of swelling profit margins. The drugs moved out of the nightclub scene and into open-air markets. But perhaps their most treacherous attempt at modernization was the recruitment of kids to join the expanding workforce. And among the prime recruiting targets were the teenagers in the Lafayette Courts housing projects, where many of Wade&#x2019;s players had resided over the years.<br> <br>When Wade was coaching in the early 1980s, cocaine experienced a phenomenal growth in popularity on the already battered streets of urban America. With the bountiful supply of cocaine available, enterprising teens began setting up their own shops, running back and forth via Greyhound bus or Amtrak trains to Upper Manhattan&#x2019;s Washington Heights neighborhood, where they could buy unlimited supplies of high-grade cocaine at wholesale prices. As the adolescent army and new breed of drug dealer flourished, they proved to be wantonly reckless and indiscriminately violent in settling turf wars with rival dealers for the prime drug market corners.<br> <br>In addition to their fancy clothes, flashy cars, and sparkling jewelry, they also owned a stupefying amount of high-powered semiautomatic weapons. Where the teen gangs of Wade&#x2019;s East Baltimore were fighting with their hands or knives to settle who the toughest crew was, the teen gangs of East Baltimore in the 1980s were fighting with deadly assault weapons to control the multimillion-dollar narcotics trade. And the body count was becoming increasingly filled with innocent children and working folks who happened to get caught in the crossfire.<br> <br>&#x201c;The drug culture in Baltimore underwent a significant change with the emergence of a dealer by the name of Maurice &#x2018;Peanut&#x2019; King in the late 1970s, whose rise was precipitated by a joint federal and city law enforcement task force that basically took down the older, major heroin dealers, one by one,&#x201d; said Sunni Khalid, a former crime reporter for the Baltimore Sun. &#x201c;They thought they&#x2019;d be able to dry up the market for heroin, but I-95, which ran right through the heart of Baltimore, was the East Coast&#x2019;s main drug corridor, and Peanut King simply filled the vacuum. But he changed the dynamic of the city&#x2019;s drug business philosophy because he took advantage of Maryland&#x2019;s lax juvenile justice system, employing teenagers to sell his drugs.<br> <br>&#x201c;This was at a time when Baltimore was deindustrializing. East Baltimore was a collection of blue-collar neighborhoods from the 1920s through the late 1970s and early &#x2019;80s, but when the shipyards and steelyards started closing down, the neighborhoods and schools started falling into disrepair. These teenage drug dealers became their family&#x2019;s main wage earners. The proximity of the drugs drew closer to the schools and as cocaine moved in, you had guys like Peanut King reconfiguring the old drug territories, giving the responsibility on the retail level to this army of young, undisciplined, and uneducated kids. As the years progressed, the drug dealers became younger and younger.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Eastern District used to be the smallest of the city&#x2019;s nine police districts, only 3.1 square miles, but they started experiencing the highest number of drug-related shootings. The dealers were fighting for territories, and they were arming themselves with arsenals. AK-47 assault rifles started showing up on the streets, as did bulletproof vests. The open-air drug markets opened in the early 1980s and stayed open for business, twenty-four hours a day, for close to twenty years. So you had this erosion of respect for elders and any type of authority figures. The effects devastated the community, and the incarceration rates skyrocketed. The mothers, once the strength of the family unit, were now out in the streets chasing the cocaine and crack high.<br> <br>&#x201c;The local economy had broken down, the neighborhoods were being transformed for the worse, the good jobs dried up, and family units and schools broke down. It was all such a vicious cycle.&#x201d;<br> <br>But while the street culture and mentality of the community were changing, Wade remained rigid in his adherence to old-school principles. One thing he would not tolerate on the basketball court was showboating. No one was ever allowed, after a great play or a victory, to thrust his pointer finger in the air, signifying that he was number one. The Poets were inculcated with the philosophy that to disrespect one&#x2019;s opponent was disrespectful to the game itself. If a player threw a behind-the-back pass where a simple chest or bounce pass would have sufficed, he found himself sitting on the bench shortly thereafter.<br> <br>When the final school bell rang on that late autumn afternoon in 1981, the Dunbar players made their way to study hall. At exactly 3:30 p.m., study hall commenced, and the only sounds to be heard were the opening and closing of textbooks, the whirring of the ventilation system, and snippets of conversation from the adjacent corridors and stairwell.<br> <br>Before anyone could practice, he was required to complete every homework assignment due the next day. Wade set no specified time to start practice; it came after study hall. Only after the homework was reviewed by one of the teachers who volunteered as tutors could players go to the gym. Practice began when the last textbook was closed.<br> <br>&#x201c;There are certain expectations that are placed on you as a player who wears the Dunbar uniform,&#x201d; Wade said, launching into his standard speech before commencing the inaugural practice of each season. &#x201c;You should have been working out on your own, and if you haven&#x2019;t, we&#x2019;ll soon find out. It&#x2019;s not going to be easy. Because of who we are, there is a target that will always be on your back. In order to deal with that, day in and day out, we will go that extra mile. No one will be more prepared and in better condition than we will. No one has invented a pill that you can swallow to get you in the kind of shape that you need to be in. It starts right here.&#x201d;<br> <br>He spoke as if he were reciting items on a grocery list, but Wade was still burning on the inside at how the previous season had ended. He was eager to begin again. Although there were many recent additions to the team and personalities that needed to be incorporated into his system, he liked what he saw early on. This team had size, speed, and quickness. They were tough and looked hungry.<br> <br>He blew his whistle, and the players strapped on the sand-filled backpacks that sat at their feet. They then scooped up two bricks, one for each hand, and a seemingly endless number of full-court sprints followed. Then, to half-court and back followed by suicide runs&#x2014;sprints to the nearest free-throw line and back to the baseline, followed immediately by a sprint to the half-court line and back to the baseline, with an ensuing sprint to the free-throw line at the other end of the court and back to the baseline, concluded by a full-court dash to the far baseline and back.<br> <br>The players were then separated into small groups and instructed to continuously jump as high as they could, with the bricks extended over their heads, up and down and up an...</p><h2>On Difficulties in the Church Fathers, Vol. 1: The Ambigua, (Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library</h2><p>Maximos the Confessor (580-662) occupies a unique position in the history of Byzantine philosophy, theology, and spirituality. His profound spiritual experiences and penetrating theological vision found complex and often astonishing expression in his unparalleled command of Greek philosophy, making him one of the most challenging and original Christian thinkers of all time. So thoroughly did his thought come to influence the Byzantine theological tradition that it is impossible to trace the subsequent history of Orthodox Christianity without knowledge of his work. The <i>Ambigua</i> (or "Book of Difficulties") is Maximos's greatest philosophical and doctrinal work, in which his daring originality, prodigious talent for speculative thinking, and analytical acumen are on lavish display. In the <i>Ambigua,</i> a broad range of theological topics--cosmology, anthropology, the philosophy of mind and language, allegory, asceticism, and metaphysics--are transformed in a synthesis of Aristotelian logic, Platonic metaphysics, Stoic psychology, and the arithmetical philosophy of a revived Pythagoreanism. The result is a labyrinthine map of the mind's journey to God that figured prominently in the Neoplatonic revival of the Komnenian Renaissance and the Hesychast Controversies of the Late Byzantine period. This remarkable work has never before been available in a critically based edition or English translation.</p><p><p>Nicholas Constas, formerly Associate Professor at the Harvard Divinity School, is a monk at the Simonopetra Monastery, Mt.

One of these &#x201c;spirit people&#x201d; delivered a message that would ultimately save her life. Still, she wanted nothing to do with these visitors and sought help from her local Spiritualist church. There she learned to embrace these new experiences, opening her to a lifetime of service that has spanned continents. World-renowned and universally respected and beloved as a medium and teacher for over fifty years, Mavis Pittilla remains modest and humble. The story of her life reveals a multi-faceted, endearing woman who has overcome tremendous adversity, much of it caused by her own human frailties. Droplets of God is far more than Mavis&#x2019;s fascinating biography. It is a primer of the foundations of mediumship, the key philosophical teachings of Spiritualism, and of the soul&#x2019;s journey of self-realization.</p><p></p><h2>The Great Wave: Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History</h2><p>David Hackett Fischer, one of our most prominent historians, has garnered a reputation for making history come alive--even stories as familiar as Paul Revere's ride, or as complicated as the assimilation of British culture in North America. Now, in <em>The Great Wave</em>, Fischer has done it again, marshaling an astonishing array of historical facts in lucid and compelling prose to outline a history of prices--"the history of change," as Fischer puts it--covering the dazzling sweep of Western history from the medieval glory of Chartres to the modern day. Going far beyond the economic data, Fischer writes a powerful history of the people of the Western world: the economic patterns they lived in, and the politics, culture, and society that they created as a result. As he did in <em>Albion's Seed</em> and <em>Paul Revere's Ride</em>, two of the most talked-about history books in recent years, Fischer combines extensive research and meticulous scholarship with wonderfully evocative writing to create a book for scholars and general readers alike.<br><br>Records of prices are more abundant than any other quantifiable data, and span the entire range of history, from tables of medieval grain prices to the overabundance of modern statistics. Fischer studies this wealth of data, creating a narrative that encompasses all of Western culture. He describes four waves of price revolutions, each beginning in a period of equilibrium: the High Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and finally the Victorian Age. Each revolution is marked by continuing inflation, a widening gap between rich and poor, increasing instability, and finally a crisis at the crest of the wave that is characterized by demographic contraction, social and political upheaval, and economic collapse. The most violent of these climaxes was the catastrophic fourteenth century, in which war, famine, and the Black Death devastated the continent--the only time in Europe's history that the population actually declined.<br><br> Fischer also brilliantly illuminates how these long economic waves are closely intertwined with social and political events, affecting the very mindset of the people caught in them. The long periods of equilibrium are marked by cultural and intellectual movements--such as the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Victorian Age-- based on a belief in order and harmony and in the triumph of progress and reason. By contrast, the years of price revolution created a melancholy culture of despair.<br><br> Fischer suggests that we are living now in the last stages of a price revolution that has been building since the turn of the century. The destabilizing price surges and declines and the diminished expectations the United States has suffered in recent years--and the famines and wars of other areas of the globe--are typical of the crest of a price revolution. He does not attempt to predict what will happen, noting that "uncertainty about the future is an inexorable fact of our condition." Rather, he ends with a brilliant analysis of where we <em>might</em> go from here and what our choices are now. This book is essential reading for anyone concerned about the state of the world today.<br></p><p>David Hackett Fischer is a master storyteller, capable of writing challenging histories in highly enjoyable prose. His earlier works, <i>Albion's Seed</i> and Paul Revere's Ride, have both been hailed for their extraordinary success as both scholarly achievements and readable histories. In <i>The Great Wave</i>, Professor Fischer directs his erudite attention to the ebbs and flows of prices, demonstrating that the historical costs of goods shed much light on patterns of human events, and the interpretation of those prices in turn discloses a great deal about the methods and biases of historians. The result is an intriguing study of both human history and a critical appraisal of the historian's craft. The greatest talent Fischer demonstrates is the ability to master a diverse amount of quantitative data and organize it into a remarkably clear story. Certain to interest lay readers, investors, and serious students alike, <i>The Great Wave</i> changes the way you look at those common signposts known as prices.&#34;The history of prices is the history of change&#34;, writes David Hackett Fischer in this broad sweep of western history from the middle ages to our own time. His primary sources are price records, which are more abundant for the study of historical change than any other type of quantifiable data. Fischer uses these materials to frame a narrative of price-movements in western history from the eleventh century to the present. He finds that prices tended to rise throughout this long period, but most of their increase happened in four great waves of inflation - which he calls the price-revolutions of the thirteenth, sixteenth, eighteenth, and twentieth centuries. The four waves shared many qualities in common. All had the same movements of prices and price-relatives, falling real wages, rising returns to capital, and growing gaps between rich and poor. They were also very similar in the structure of change. Each of them started silently, developed increasing instability, and ended in a shattering crisis that combined social disorder, political upheaval, economic collapse, and demographic contraction. These crises happened in the fourteenth, seventeenth, and late eighteenth centuries. They were followed by long periods of comparative equilibrium: the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Victorian era. In all of these eras prices fell and stabilized, wages rose, and inequalities diminished. Then another great wave began and the pattern repeated itself, but not in precisely the same way. Fischer quotes Mark Twain: history doesn&#39;t repeat itself, but it rhymes. Through all of these movements, Fischer explores the linkages between economic trends, social tendencies, political events, andcultural processes. He finds that long periods of price-equilibrium were marked by a faith in order, harmony, progress, and reason. By contrast, price-revolutions created cultures of despair in their middle and later stages. Fischer examines the cause of these movements, and discusses the models that have been used to explain them. He also considers their consequences. Fischer does not attempt to predict what will happen next, noting that &#34;uncertainty about the future is an inexorable fact of our condition&#34;. Rather, he ends with an analysis of where we might go from here, and what our choices are now. This book should be required reading for anyone who is seriously concerned about the state of the world today.</p><h2>Understanding and Applying Medical Anthropology</h2><p><p>The editors of the third edition of the seminal textbook <em>Understanding and Applying Medical Anthropology</em> bring it completely up to date for both instructors and students.

Drawing upon intersectionality theory and critical race studies, she demonstrates how living at the intersection of racism and sexism exposes women of color to unique experiences of gendered racism that are not about relationships, but rather are about systems of power and inequity.</p><p>Refuting the idea that race and racism are &#x201c;one-size-fits-all,&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>I Bring the Voices of My People&nbsp;</i>highlights the particular work that White Americans must do to repent of racism and to work toward racial justice and offers a constructive view of reconciliation that prioritizes eliminating racial injustice and healing the damage that it has done to African Americans and other people of color.</p></p><p><br><b>Chanequa Walker-Barnes</b>&nbsp;is a clinical psychologist, public theologian, and minister.

However, the seeds for this book were sown in my own health crisis. Like 23.5 million other Americans, I suffer from autoimmune disease, and it has ravaged my life, placing before me the greatest obstacles I have ever known. Pages of this book were written during different stays in the small white hospital rooms of Johns Hopkins Hospital, and many chapters were drafted during long bedridden months at home.</p><p>The greatest of these challenges began one fine spring afternoon as I was celebrating "Carpet Day" with my daughter. Carpet Day is our own personal mother-child holiday, celebrated only by us. On the first great spring day we take an old carpet and unroll it on our suburban drive. We bring pillows, chalk, snacks, and lemonade and lie there, reading and chatting, pretending it's the beach for a whole afternoon. On Carpet Day, you can almost hear the seagulls and feel the breeze from the ocean waves that we still won't visit for months. That day, we brought our golden retriever puppy outside with us. He saw a squirrel, and off he went. I bounded after him, or tried to, only to find that my left leg wouldn't follow my right. I hurtled headlong into the grass.</p><p>Over the next seventy-two hours, my left leg, then my right, then both arms lost all muscle control as my body underwent what was -- for me -- the all-too-familiar creeping paralysis of Guillain-Barr� syndrome, an autoimmune illness in which the nerve's myelin sheaths are destroyed by the body's own immune system.</p><p>Guillain-Barr� syndrome, or GBS, usually attacks a month or so after a patient has had a common viral or bacterial infection. Just three weeks earlier, I had had a stomach bug. My body's immune fighter cells had mounted a war to eliminate those germs, but once they'd achieved that goal, instead of ceasing their attack they turned on my own body -- in a deadly game of self-sabotage. With Guillain-Barr�, the immune system gets its wires dangerously crossed and while trying to fight off the infectious agent also damages the myelin sheaths that wrap around all of our nerves like a protective insulation. The damage is so rapid that a patient's myelin sheaths and the axonal nerves they protect can be methodically and painfully stripped away -- leaving them entirely paralyzed within weeks, or even days.</p><p>It was the second time in four years that I had been paralyzed with GBS. Once before, in the spring of 2001, when my son was six and my daughter two, I had developed this same bizarre and devastating disease after a stomach bug. In 2001, physicians at the local emergency room confidently misdiagnosed my leg weakness and back pain as a back injury and prescribed bed rest. But instead of improving with rest, I lost nerve and muscle control in my legs by steady degrees over a period of nearly two weeks. One day I could stand on my toes, a few days later I couldn't quite manage it. A few days after that I couldn't flex my feet. A week later, I would stand up and try not to crash into the wall, but suddenly the wall would be there to greet me.</p><p>A day or two later, I attempted to get to my two-year-old after she bloodied her toe by stubbing it on the leg of my dresser, but I couldn't make it there, even on my knees. The communiqu�s my brain sent to my body to feel the floor beneath my feet simply didn't connect.</p><p>One afternoon my son, then six, tried to rouse me by showing me how competent he'd become overnight at tying his shoes, as if by some magical power he could banish his mom's bizarre inability to budge from bed.</p><p>"Look, Mom!" he called to me from downstairs, near the front door where we kept our shoes. "I tied my shoes! On my <i>own!</i>" There was a moment's pause, and then -- making a decision to ignore the no-shoes-in-the-house rule -- he clambered up the stairs to show me his handiwork, pride widening his smile.</p><p>"<i>Great</i> job, buddy." I tousled his hair and smiled back, ignoring the sneaker prints trailing behind him across the bedroom rug.</p><p>"Mom?" he asked, his tone uncertain. "Can you help me tighten the loops?" He put his foot up on the side of the bed. I tried to pull at both laces to make the floppy loops smaller but my fingers weren't strong enough.</p><p>"I can't manage it at the moment, buddy," I said. His face grew ashen and tight. I tried to comfort him, repeating a made-up acronym I sometimes used to soothe my children, hoping it would do the trick again. "Remember? My love for you is very FINE -- it is Forever, Infinite, Neverending, and <i>Everywhere</i> you go." We lay side by side, my words all I had to embrace him with as I struggled to hide my own panic. Why was I losing muscle control in my arms as well as my legs?</p><p>Within twenty-four hours, my breathing became shallow and short. It was clear I was facing something other than a back problem. I was admitted to Hopkins, where the neurologist who took my case ordered infusions of immunoglobulin, or other people's healthy immune cells, the standard treatment for GBS. In many first-time cases, but not all, GBS paralysis is 90-percent reversible with treatment, and the myelin sheaths begin to regenerate. It is a remarkable process. If left untreated, GBS can be fatal; the paralysis spreads to the lungs, and patients require intubation -- a tube inserted into the airway to prevent them from suffocating to death. In 2001, I recovered well with immunoglobulin treatments followed by months of physical therapy. Although I was left with strange neurological bells and whistles -- jingly nerve endings, tired, locked muscles, twitchy connections -- it seemed a minuscule price to pay for being able to walk unassisted again.</p><p>I was so very fortunate.</p><p>Still, other problems emerged. I was told that I also had leucopenia, a dangerously low white blood cell count. Leucopenia and GBS came on the heels of two earlier autoimmune diagnoses that had spanned the previous fifteen years. Small-fiber sensory neuropathy, which leads to a permanent loss of some of the normal sensation in the hands and feet, and hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid. In addition, I suffered from vasovagal syncope, a fainting and seizure disorder caused by the heart sending incorrect signals from the brain to the vagus nerve and failing to pump enough blood through the body, "cured" by doctors surgically implanting a pacemaker when I was twenty-eight.</p><p>Still, when Guillain-Barr� struck a second time in April 2005, it came as a devastating shock. You simply were not supposed to get GBS twice. If you did, your chances of regenerating your nerves went from 90 percent to -- well, no one quite knew. Toward the end of my hospital stay in the rehabilitation center, my physical medicine specialist stood at my bedside one day, patting my leg. "You might not get any better than you are right now," she warned, her voice soft for the blow. "But that doesn't mean you should give up hope."</p><p>I had no intention of giving up hope. As a child, I had watched my father suffer through a constellation of what I have since learned were autoimmune illnesses: inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and leucopenia. By the time my father was forty-two years old, he could barely walk a step without wincing with joint pain, and his bowels were continually inflamed. He died without warning one August morning following routine abdominal surgery to remove inflamed parts of his duodenum. I was twelve. It turned out that the heavy steroids his rheumatologist had prescribed for his arthritis had eaten through the sutures his stomach surgeon had sewn in, and the peritonitis that ensued caused his body to go into shock and his heart to arrest. "Normal courses of antibiotics proved unsuccessful," read his death report.</p><p>We knew so little then. Still, thirty years later, when my own frightening journey through autoimmune disease began, it seemed to me that we knew little more than we had in my father's era.</p><p>As I lay on that hospital bed with Guillain-Barr� for a second time in 2005, I couldn't help but compare my father's odyssey to my own. Like him, it seemed I possessed an irrationally overexuberant immune system. I lay in a hospital bed in the same medical institution, Johns Hopkins, one ward over from where my father had died from autoimmune-related complications at almost the very same age I was now. With a young son and daughter at home yet to raise, the similarities terrified me.</p><p>Back home, physical therapy, meditation, and an autoimmune-preventive diet all helped to bring incremental gains in mobility. I would later come to think of that time as a five-month journey around my room, often accompanied by my physical therapist at my side, as I sweated to graduate from wheelchair to walker to cane -- with no guarantee that I would improve. As one doctor explained, "You've had several forest fires, and each time it's harder and harder to get healthy regrowth." It was the second time in four years that my work as a journalist came to a sudden halt. Deadline after deadline passed. I was simply too weak to sit in front of a computer, let alone tap out words on the keyboard. I tried to get to the bathroom one night on my own, using my walker, without waking my husband to help steady me, but misjudged my stamina. On the way back I crashed into a window and fell in a heap on the floor, unable to get up on so much as one elbow. When you hear the phrase "and he scraped her up off the floor" and wonder what that really means, it means exactly what my husband did that night.

The first person of African descent to publish a book of poems in English, she was emancipated by her owners in recognition of her literary achievement. For a time, Wheatley was the most famous black woman in the West. But Thomas Jefferson, unlike his contemporaries Ben Franklin and George Washington, refused to acknowledge her gifts as a writer&#x2014;a repudiation that eventually inspired generations of black writers to build an extraordinary body of literature in their efforts to prove him wrong.<p>In <i>The Trials of Phillis Wheatley</i>, Henry Louis Gates Jr. explores the pivotal roles that Wheatley and Jefferson played in shaping the black literary tradition. Writing with all the lyricism and critical skill that place him at the forefront of American letters, Gates brings to life the characters, debates, and controversy that surrounded Wheatley in her day and ours.</p></p><p><b>Henry Louis Gates Jr.</b> is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor at Harvard University. His books include <i>Colored People</i>, <i>Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man</i>, and <i>In Search of Our Roots</i>. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Gates brings scholarly insight and a love of black literature to this examination of how Wheatley, the first published African American poet, has survived the judgment of past and contemporary critics. After her poems appeared in 1773, distinguished American citizens (mostly white male slaveholders) set out to determine if Wheatley, or for that matter any black person, was capable of the higher thoughts and emotions required to create poetry. Underlying the debate was the humanity of blacks, the justification for their enslavement, and the moral culpability of the slaveholders. While Benjamin Franklin and George Washington accepted Wheatley's talent, Thomas Jefferson remained skeptical, shifting the focus from the authenticity of her authorship to the quality of her work. Generations later, black nationalists would also focus on the ideological quality of Wheatley's work, vilifying her as an apologist for slavery. But in this slim, lively volume, Gates extols Wheatley's enduring literary significance and Jefferson's contribution to spurring a tradition of black literature that was first aimed at proving equality and came to signify a black aesthetic. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I&#x2019;d recently upgraded from Mr. Coffee to one of those machines that used pre-measured plastic cups. I placed my mug under the filter, clamped down the lid, and returned to my desk. Demonic hissing sounds echoed in my office. <i>Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?</i></p><p>&#x201c;God,&#x201d; Connie said. &#x201c;I feel like the biggest idiot in Boston.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t worry about that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s quite an elite club,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The line stretches all the way from Mass Ave down to Mattapoissett.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought I loved him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did he say he loved you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how I found myself back in �therapy. I haven&#x2019;t been to see Dr. Silverman for years. I thought I was cured.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Silverman might say therapy isn&#x2019;t a cure,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a �process.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a very intelligent woman.&#x201d;</p><p>I gave Connie a big smile, letting her know I echoed the sentiment. When the hissing and spitting ceased, I retrieved the mug and a carton of milk, a few packs of sugar, and a clean spoon. I set them on the desk near her and returned to my seat.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked a lot of unusual jobs,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I have to admit, helping with relationships isn&#x2019;t my specialty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want help,&#x201d; Connie Kelly said. &#x201c;I need to know who he really is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean deep down?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know he&#x2019;s a phony, a liar, and a two-timing, backstabbing son of a bitch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yikes.&#x201d;</p><p>She busily added sugar and milk to her coffee with shaking hands. Despite her mood, Connie Kelly was dressed in a white sleeveless silk top with a black pencil skirt adorned with chrysanthemums and a pair of black open-toe heels that highlighted her shapely calves. Her toes had been painted a festive red.</p><p>&#x201c;As true as that might be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s more.&#x201d;</p><p>Being a trained investigator and a master listener, I waited. Pleasant city sounds drifted up from Berkeley Street on a cool, almost fall-like breeze. I leaned back in my chair, resting my hands on my thighs, still dressed in a sweaty gray T-shirt and running shorts. I had intended to check my mail, not meet with a client. But she&#x2019;d been there waiting before I opened the door.</p><p>&#x201c;He has two hundred and sixty thousand dollars of my money,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He swindled it from me and then disappeared.&#x201d;</p><p>I withheld from snapping my fingers and saying, &#x201c;Now we&#x2019;re talking.&#x201d; Instead, I nodded with grave understanding. The promise&nbsp;of money made me quite attentive, especially after a slow summer and losing my apartment and all my worldly possessions in a recent fire.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know if M. Brooks Welles is his real name.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That name sounds familiar,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Should I know him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you a member of many social clubs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does the corner barstool at the Tennessee Tavern count?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hardly,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;When we were together, he seldom passed on a charity event or dinner invitation. Come to think of it, I never saw him pick up a check. People loved being around a guy who got his face on TV.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Actor?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Worse,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Pundit.&#x201d;</p><p>She ran down the names of several cable news channels where Welles had appeared as an expert. I inquired about his area of expertise.</p><p>&#x201c;He said he was in the CIA,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He spoke on terrorism, military affairs, politics. Mainly how we&#x2019;d failed to keep our country safe. He was a very popular speaker after the marathon bombings. He said the current administration and their liberal policies had failed us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How, when, and under what pretense did Mr. Welles take your money?&#x201d;</p><p>Connie let out a long breath and reached for the coffee with both hands. She sipped and with great care returned the mug to the desk. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so naked and awful,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It was two months ago. Real estate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me guess,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A foolproof investment?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Land up near Walden Pond,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He said he&#x2019;d hunted there as a boy and the place had given him great solace.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The only thing I knew people to hunt around Walden Pond were rats.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t ask many questions,&#x201d; Connie said, shaking her head, her eyes growing moist. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t ask him anything at all. I met very few of his friends and no family.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Love is blind,&#x201d;</i> I said.&nbsp;</p><p>I toasted her with my mug. She smiled for the first time since entering my office. &#x201c;Bryn Mawr. English.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You and Kate Hepburn.&#x201d; I reached for a yellow legal pad and my pen. &#x201c;What is it that you&#x2019;d like me to do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want you to run a background check on him.&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;You could do that online. You don&#x2019;t need me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I want my goddamn money back and his ass hanging out to dry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;</p><p>I wrote down a few notes, taking care with the details about his ass drying out. I put down the pen and drank some coffee. After running five miles, I was having fantasies about stopping off at Kane&#x2019;s for a couple of old-fashioneds to replenish my carbs.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m four hundred dollars a day,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Plus expenses.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t flinch, and instead reached into her purse for a checkbook. The checks were sandwiched between handsome alligator covers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be glad to pay for a week in advance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how long it will take,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And I can&#x2019;t promise any legal action or justice. Although I do know a very competent and very mean redheaded attorney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Just the facts, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;The Bard and Joe Friday?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am one literate son of a gun.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard you often amuse yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t put anything by ol&#x2019; Doc Silverman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shall I tell you everything I know about M. Brooks Welles?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know much, but I do think he might be dangerous,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Very dangerous. I think back on things he told me and they make me shudder. He confided in me that he&#x2019;s killed many men.&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged and thought about flexing my biceps or showing off the&nbsp;.357 Magnum I kept in my right-hand drawer. But doing so might seem gauche to a gal from Bryn Mawr, so I just listened.</p><p>&#x201c;I asked for it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We met each other through an �Internet dating site. He told me that after Vietnam, he joined the CIA and then went on to write books and produce movies. I saw him several times on television, so I trusted he was telling me the truth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have a photo?&#x201d;</p><p>She reached into her purse and pulled out a picture of a man in his sixties with silvery hair and a saltwater tan, wearing expensive duds. Starched white shirt wide open at the throat, navy blazer with brass buttons. Connie Kelly was seated beside him at some waterfront restaurant. They were laughing and looked very happy. I didn&#x2019;t wish to judge, but he looked a bit long in the tooth for her.</p><p>&#x201c;I wanted a tall, successful, and interesting man. Someone who liked to travel and took time to enjoy sunsets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pi�a coladas and getting caught in the rain?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I should have said honest but ran out of room on my profile,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I guess I left the door wide open for this kind of thing. My husband left me two years ago for a flight attendant from Dallas. I am not what you&#x2019;d call a stunner, but Brooks made me feel very beautiful. I do know I&#x2019;m smart and very good at what I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I work as an administrator for Jumpstart,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Are you familiar with the organization?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They do great work. Do you have children?&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head. She didn&#x2019;t touch the coffee again. But she ripped out the check and dropped it on my desk.</p><p>&#x201c;Let me see what I can do.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled again. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re different than Dr. Silverman described&nbsp;you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bigger? More stunning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Quieter,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;More self-contained.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I tried to put that on the business cards,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But ran out of&nbsp;room.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>I drove home to my new digs in the Charlestown Navy Yard and made breakfast. As I ate two poached eggs with a side of locally cured bacon from the Public Market, I pulled up YouTube clips of M. Brooks Welles doing his thing. It was liberating doing my job in&nbsp;a terry-cloth robe while munching on bacon. I wondered why I didn&#x2019;t begin every day like this. Skip the workouts, head right to the breakfast meats and sleuthing.</p><p>Pearl sat by my side as I worked. Her yellow eyes were dutiful and glowing. She wanted either to show me her love or me to share. I pinched off a piece of bacon and tossed it to the floor. On my computer, Welles was introduced as a former Navy SEAL, Vietnam vet, and CIA operative. Special consul to foreign affairs committees. He was sleek and confident. He spoke in a gravelly, knowing voice filled with authority and wore an American flag pin on his lapel. I resisted the urge to salute my MacBook.</p><p>He called the president at the time a clown and a fraud. He claimed he knew of dozens of Muslim paramilitary training camps within the United States. He said, based on his experience, that tougher immigration standards and screening processes needed to be put in place or we&#x2019;d be visiting 9/11 all over again. He talked a lot about his time in the CIA, offering vague comments about his mission in South America making tough calls and doing the work in the shadows. Over the years, I had known men and women who&#x2019;d done that kind of work. They seldom spoke of it. Even in vague terms.</p><p>Welles relished in it. More talk about working with Air America, battling the Communist threat, and now looking at a battlefront at home. As the interview continued, Welles was intercut with images of the marathon bombing. I had enough and closed the screen.</p><p>Pearl looked up at me. Ever vigilant, she knew I still had half a piece of bacon left. I tossed it to her and walked back to get dressed. Pearl trotted beside me, still not confident in the new place.</p><p>The old shipping warehouse had been built not long after the Civil War and had a nice view of the yards and the U.S.S. <i>Constitution,</i> with tall ceilings and a big plate-glass window, exposed brick walls, and floors fashioned from the decks of old ships. Rustic. Susan found it amusing I resided so close to Old Ironsides.</p><p>I slipped into a pair of jeans, a blue pocket T-shirt, and Nikes and went back to the laptop propped on the kitchen counter. I ran Welles&#x2019;s name through the Department of Motor Vehicles and a LexisNexis search. Nothing. Connie Kelly had passed on one of Welles&#x2019;s business cards for a company called EDGE. I ran the company through the Secretary of the Commonwealth database and found an address in Cambridge. <i>Tally-ho.</i> I slipped my&nbsp;.38 just below my right hip, reached for my Braves cap, and grabbed my car&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Pearl and I were off to Central Square. Her long brown ears blew in the wind as we drove along Memorial Drive against the Charles. Rowers rowed, joggers jogged, and bench sitters sat. It was mid-�September and the air had turned crisp. The leaves had already started to turn red and gold, shining in Technicolor upon the still water.</p><p>The address led me to a narrow, wedge-shaped building where Western Avenue joined with River Street. There was a directory by a locked door with Lilliputian type. Undeterred, I slipped on a pair of cheaters and searched for any mention of Welles or EDGE. Nothing. Two real-estate firms, a lawyer, and a classic-car broker. I slipped the cheaters back into my shirt pocket and called the building&#x2019;s management company from my cell.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, a heavyset woman in a dark blue pantsuit crawled out of a small silver BMW. She had a cell phone screwed tightly into her ear and wore an abundance of gold jewelry. I knew her name was Joanne D&#x2019;Ambrosio and she had an office in the North End. I told her I was a prospective renter.</p><p>&#x201c;Alfred LaRue,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Friends call me Lash.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s your business, Mr. LaRue?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I vanquish foes.&#x201d;</p><p>She was half listening, looking at the number of someone who was calling. &#x201c;We have three units available,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;How much square footage to you need? And how soon do you need it?&#x201d;</p><p>She unlocked the front door and we walked down a narrow hallway. The carpet was beige, threadbare, and spotty as a Dalmatian. The walls were scuffed with black marks and badly in need of paint. I ran my hands along some uneven spackling.</p><p>&#x201c;The landlord looks to make improvements at the first of the year,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The building had been in bankruptcy. That should all be worked out soon. Do you live in Cambridge?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I keep a toothbrush here. I heard about this building from my old pal, Brooks Welles. He said it was quiet and reasonable.&#x201d;</p><p>If she recognized the name, it didn&#x2019;t register. She stood in the hall, checking messages on her phone.</p><p>&#x201c;Is he still on the first floor?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;M.

Did he ever tell you what he did for a living?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A little of this,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;a little of that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A four-flusher,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what my father called people like him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did he leave anything else in the office?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like I said,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Garbage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any bills?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Files? Documents?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you say your name was?&#x201d; she said, eyeing me. She crossed her arms and checked me out from ball cap to Nikes. I shrugged, reached into my pocket, and handed her my business card, the real one with the skull and crossbones to let people know I was serious. I offered her the full-wattage smile.</p></p><h2>Tractor: The Heartland Innovation, Ground-Breaking Machines, Midnight Schemes, Secret Garages, and Farmyard Geniuses that Mechanized Agriculture</h2><p>This rollicking ride into machine history follows the innovators, entrepreneurs and hucksters who transformed our world with farm machines. Starting with the turn-of-the-century visionaries who saw that four wheels and a motor could replace the horse, the book moves swiftly through key early developments to cover the power farming movement of the latter part of the 20th Century a time when major manufacturers lagged behind and independent builders and farmers began creating their own solutions with a pencil drawing and a welder. The book includes stories of the butcher shop where John Deere secretly designed a completely new line of four and six-cylinder tractors, to the skullduggery and corporate raiding that took place in fields and back lots as company agents schemed to discover what their dirty ol competition had up their sleeves. The book moves all the way up through the creation of the first tractor electronics, the merger movement of the 1980s, and the emergence of the high-technology innovations such as smart farms and auto-guidance which are changing the farm as we know it. With images from Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, Dennis Stock, and many more as well as design drawings from Henry Dreyfuss, Raymond Loewy, Brooks Stevens and more, this raucous, heartfelt book shines a light on some of the bright minds and innovative companies which emerged from the fertile fields of Americas heartland.</p><p>Lee Klancher&#39;s adventures in journalism have sent he and his camera out to climb Mount Triglav in the Julian Alps, explore breweries on four continents, and ride backcountry motorcycle routes in the Bolivian Amazon, the Australian Outback, and on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. He has appeared in Men&#39;s Journal, Draft, Motorcyclist, and dozens of books and calendars. His favorite subjects are independent craftspeople who earn their livings working with their hands and doing what they love.</p><h2>Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit</h2><p><p>Many of us fail to recognize that obtaining the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential to getting to heaven. We often block their reception through our own faults. We fail to see how they are passed on or strengthened in the sacraments. And, sadly, we forget to petition God in prayer to bestow these gifts upon us.</p> <p>In these pages, Dr. Kevin Vost best-selling author of <i>The One-Minute Aquinas</i> provides us with a substantive yet readable introduction to the seven gifts and how we can humbly submit our wills to the stirrings of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p>As Dr. Vost explains, these God-given gifts help us to conform our lives to His image, intellect and will. They prevent us from being drawn into frustration and possibly self-destruction by following our own sensual appetites. Indeed, the gifts of the Holy Spirit are the only path to being fully happy on earth and in the life to come.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Square Meal: A Culinary History of the Great Depression</h2><p><p><strong>James Beard Foundation Book Award Winner</strong></p><p>From the author of the acclaimed <em>97 Orchard</em> and her husband, a culinary historian, an in-depth exploration of the greatest food crisis the nation has ever faced&#x2014;the Great Depression&#x2014;and how it transformed America&#x2019;s culinary culture.</p><p>The decade-long Great Depression, a period of shifts in the country&#x2019;s political and social landscape, forever changed the way America eats. Before 1929, America&#x2019;s relationship with food was defined by abundance. But the collapse of the economy, in both urban and rural America, left a quarter of all Americans out of work and undernourished&#x2014;shattering long-held assumptions about the limitlessness of the national larder.</p><p>In 1933, as women struggled to feed their families, President Roosevelt reversed long-standing biases toward government-sponsored &#x201c;food charity.&#x201d; For the first time in American history, the federal government assumed, for a while, responsibility for feeding its citizens. The effects were widespread. Championed by Eleanor Roosevelt, &#x201c;home economists&#x201d; who had long fought to bring science into the kitchen rose to national stature.</p><p>Tapping into America&#x2019;s long-standing ambivalence toward culinary enjoyment, they imposed their vision of a sturdy, utilitarian cuisine on the American dinner table. Through the Bureau of Home Economics, these women led a sweeping campaign to instill dietary recommendations, the forerunners of today&#x2019;s Dietary Guidelines for Americans.</p><p>At the same time, rising food conglomerates introduced packaged and processed foods that gave rise to a new American cuisine based on speed and convenience. This movement toward a homogenized national cuisine sparked a revival of American regional cooking. In the ensuing decades, the tension between local traditions and culinary science has defined our national cuisine&#x2014;a battle that continues today. </p><p><em>A Square Meal</em> examines the impact of economic contraction and environmental disaster on how Americans ate then&#x2014;and the lessons and insights those experiences may hold for us today.</p><p><em>A Square Meal</em> features 25 black-and-white photographs.</p></p><p><p>The idea of America as a place of abundance is enshrined in our culture, from Jefferson&#x2019;s agrarian democracy to the immensity of our supermarkets. The Great Depression, which left a quarter of all Americans out of work and undernourished, tested our belief in this land&#x2019;s unlimited bounty, and in the process changed the way America eats.</p><p>In 1933, after four years of deprivation and national debate, President Roosevelt reversed long-standing biases toward government-sponsored &#x201c;food charity&#x201d; and assumed responsibility for feeding the hungry. Championed by Eleanor Roosevelt, &#x201c;home economists,&#x201d; who had long fought to bring science into the kitchen, rose to national stature. Through the Bureau of Home Economics, these women led a sweeping campaign to impose their vision of a sturdy, utilitarian cuisine and instill nutritional recommendations, the forerunners of today&#x2019;s Dietary Guidelines for Americans. At the same time, expanding conglomerates introduced packaged and processed foods, which led to a new American cuisine based on speed and convenience. This movement toward a homogenized national diet sparked a revival of American regional cooking that continues to this day.</p><p><em>A Square Meal</em> examines how economic contraction and environmental disaster shaped the way Americans ate during the Great Depression, and shares the lessons and insights we may learn from those experiences today.</p><p>Jane Ziegelman is the director of the Tenement Museum's culinary center and the founder and director of Kids Cook!, a multiethnic cooking program for children.

Accepting failing health and the end of her dream of becoming a missionary, Therese developed a Little Way, a spirituality of embracing the challenges and events of everyday life for the love of God. Her autobiography, <i>The Story of a Soul</i>, was a bestseller soon after her death at twenty-four. Therese was canonized in 1925 and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1997.</p><h2>Fate and Destiny, The Two Agreements of the Soul - Newly Revised and Expanded Edition</h2><p>Drawing on the experiences of his life, traditional wisdom stories, poetic and metaphoric language, etymology, and his personal brand of scholarship, Michael Meade leads us to an undeniable truth: that the only story we came here to live is our own. Often called &#34;an instant classic,&#34; in this newly revised and expanded edition of Fate and Destiny, Meade has taken his original message of the uniqueness of each life to new levels of meaning and inspiration. By elaborating key themes and polishing the gems of wisdom, Meade gives us an even more powerful opportunity to change ourselves and the world. Meade shows how the limitations of family and fate form the inner threads from which our individual destiny must emerge. He explains how our wounds can become doorways to our deepest gifts and how our greatest obstacles are intended to lead us to a treasure divinely seeded within us before birth. Amidst the current turmoil of the world, Fate and Destiny speaks directly to young people seeking to find a genuine path in life and trying to awaken to the dream they carry inside. At the same time, stories of the elders help older people find new ways to value their lives and touch the threads of their own destiny. Fate and Destiny offers everyone penetrating insights for those caught in life&#39;s inevitable struggles and shows the wisdom of elders depends upon remembering the spirit of eternal youth.</p><p>Michael Meade, born and raised in New York City, is a renowned storyteller, author, and scholar of mythology, anthropology, and psychology.

Hamilton</b> is a full-time writer and the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series and the Merry Gentry series. She lives in a suburb of St. Louis with her family.<b>1 </b><p>I WAS WORMING my way through a mass of parents and children with a tiny clown hat clutched in one hand. In my navy blue skirt suit I looked like a dozen other mothers who had had to come straight from work to the dance recital. My hair was a little curly and a little too black for all the blond mothers, but no one gave me a second glance. The one saving grace as I threaded my way through the crowd of parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and siblings was that I wasn&#x2019;t one of the parents. I was just here as moral support and last-minute costume rescuer. It was just Monica Vespucci&#x2019;s style to leave part of her son&#x2019;s costume at her house and need an emergency save. Micah and I had been running late with client meetings so we got to ride to the rescue, and now since the vast majority of the performers were female I was the only one safe to go backstage without scandalizing the mothers. What did little girls who only had male relatives do at things like this? My dad would have been at a loss. </p><p>A little girl and her mother damn near knocked me down the stairs in their rush to get up past me. The little girl was knocked into me so that my suit jacket pushed back and she was staring at my holstered gun and U.S. Marshal badge. The child&#x2019;s eyes went big as she met my eyes. The mother never noticed, dragging the silent child up the stairs. I let them get ahead of me, the little girl&#x2019;s huge, dark eyes following me until the crowd hid her from sight. She couldn&#x2019;t have been more than five. I wondered if she&#x2019;d even try to tell her mother she&#x2019;d seen a woman with a gun and a badge. </p><p>I started pushing my way up the stairs, keeping the hand with the clown hat in it close to my jacket so I wouldn&#x2019;t flash the gun by accident anymore. I was going to try to keep my occupation a secret from the screaming children and their frantic mothers. They didn&#x2019;t need to know that I hunted bad little vampires and wereanimals for the preternatural branch of the U.S. Marshals Service. They certainly didn&#x2019;t need to know that I raised zombies as my day job. I blended in as long as no one figured out who I was.</p><p>I got to the upper hallway and there was one lone male over the age of twelve being herded by his mother. She had an almost embarrassed look on her face, as if apologizing for not having a girl. I knew there were more men up here, because some of them were mine, but they were safely away from the estrogen-rich room of little girls. </p><p>Monica&#x2019;s son was under five, so he didn&#x2019;t count as male yet. He was just a generic child. Now if I could only find the generic child, hand his mother the hat, and flee to our seats where everyone was waiting for me, I&#x2019;d count it as a win, though knowing Monica she&#x2019;d need something else. I didn&#x2019;t like her at all. But her husband had been one of Jean-Claude&#x2019;s vampires who died sort of in the line of duty, so Jean-Claude made sure that he and others stood in for her lost husband. It was honorable, I even approved of it, but I avoided Monica when I could. She&#x2019;d betrayed me and a shared friend to some bad vampires once. She&#x2019;d apologized, and she depended on Jean-Claude&#x2019;s people for emergency babysitting and things like tonight. She&#x2019;d been bad because the old Master of the City had been bad; now that we had a good Master of the City, Jean-Claude, she was good. Sure, and the Easter Bunny is a friend of mine. </p><p>The fact that I had a key to her house in case of emergencies still bugged me, but Jean-Claude was right; someone who could go out in the daylight needed to have the key. He also knew that no matter how much I disliked Monica, I&#x2019;d do the right thing. He was right, damn it. A herd of pink, sequined little girls barreled past me. I hugged the wall and let the teachers chase them down. There were so many reasons I didn&#x2019;t have children yet. </p><p>I heard my name squealed out, in that high-pitched generic toddler voice, &#x201c;&#x2019;Nita, &#x2019;Nita!&#x201d; I had no idea why, but just lately Matthew, Monica&#x2019;s son, had taken a liking to me. </p><p>He came rushing at me in his bright multicolored clown outfit with the little balls on the front that matched the ones on the hat. His hair was a deep auburn like his mother&#x2019;s, but there was something about his threeyear-old face that made me think of his dead father. Robert hadn&#x2019;t been my favorite vampire, but he&#x2019;d been handsome and Matthew was a cute kid. He came running with his arms up and launched himself at me. He was not big for his age but it was still startling. I caught him and swept him up in my arms because to do anything else would have either knocked me flat or been churlish. </p><p>He put those little hands on my shoulders and leaned in for a kiss. I offered a cheek, but he touched my face and shook his head, very solemn. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a big boy now, &#x2019;Nita. I kiss like a big boy now.&#x201d; Cheek kisses had been fine until about two weeks ago, and now Matthew was very certain that cheek kisses were baby kisses. It made me wonder if Monica was being overly friendly with the new boyfriend in front of the kid. It was Monica; there would be a boyfriend. </p><p>I&#x2019;d told Monica about it and she thought it was cute. Matthew puckered up and planted one on my mouth, which meant he was wearing my very red lipstick. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;ve got my lipstick on you, and that&#x2019;s more big girl than big boy,&#x201d; I said, as I looked around for some Kleenex or something to wipe his mouth with. I was also looking for his mother. Where was Monica? </p><p>&#x201c;It is big boy if it&#x2019;s your lipstick.&#x201d; </p><p>I frowned at that tiny face just inches from mine. &#x201c;What do you mean, it&#x2019;s big boy if it&#x2019;s mine?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;All the big boys kiss you, &#x2019;Nita.&#x201d; </p><p>I had a sinking feeling that maybe it wasn&#x2019;t just Monica and a boyfriend in front of Matthew that were giving him ideas. &#x201c;Where is your mother?&#x201d; I said, and began searching the room for her a little desperately.</p> <p>She finally separated herself from the mass of women and girls of various ages and came toward us beaming. It creeped me out a little that Monica seemed to think I didn&#x2019;t hold a grudge about her betraying me five years ago. I did hold a grudge and I didn&#x2019;t trust her. She seemed unaware of that. </p><p>She had Matthew&#x2019;s curly auburn hair, cut shorter and more styled, but her face was thinner, more of a sharp triangle, as if she&#x2019;d lost weight since I saw her last. Once upon a time you could have asked if she was feeling all right, but now women dieted for no reason at all. Monica was shorter than I was by a few inches, and I was five-three. She was still in her skirt suit, too, but her blouse was white, and mine was blue. </p><p>Matthew kept his arms around my neck while she used a wet wipe on his mouth. Then she put a paler shade of lip gloss on his lips, though they didn&#x2019;t seem to need any to me. She took the hat from me and put it over his curls. If he&#x2019;d been any older the outfit would have been embarrassing to any boy I&#x2019;d ever met, but at three it was actually . . . cute. I would not admit it out loud, but it was. </p><p>&#x201c;Thank you so much, Anita,&#x201d; Monica said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe I forgot it.&#x201d; </p><p>I could, but I just smiled and kept quiet. Quiet usually worked better between Monica and me. A mass of little girls dressed in the girl version of his outfit bounced up, and he wiggled to be put down. I did so, happily. </p><p>Monica watched him run away with the others in his class with that proverbial mother&#x2019;s look: pride, love, and almost possession. I never doubted that she loved her little boy. It was one of the reasons I was nice to her. </p><p>She turned to me, still smiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad the recital is tonight so I can concentrate on the business tomorrow.&#x201d; </p><p>I nodded, and tried to make my escape. Monica was apparently a better lawyer than she was a human being, or at least Jean-Claude trusted her to do up the contracts that might, or might not, be getting signed tomorrow. I trusted Jean-Claude to be a good businessman. </p><p>&#x201c;Agreed,&#x201d; I said, and tried to slip away. </p><p>She grabbed my arm. I don&#x2019;t like to be touched by people that I&#x2019;m not close to. I stiffened under her hand, but she didn&#x2019;t seem to notice. She leaned in and whispered, &#x201c;If I was being offered a seventeen-year-old boy toy I&#x2019;d be more excited, Anita.&#x201d; </p><p>Matthew was out of sight so I let my eyes show just how happy that comment made me. Monica let go of my arm, her eyes a little wide, face surprised. &#x201c;Oh, come on, Anita, what woman wouldn&#x2019;t be flattered?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;First, I haven&#x2019;t agreed to letting him stay in St. Louis when they bring him in from Vegas tomorrow. Second, don&#x2019;t ever call him a boy toy again.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Touchy,&#x201d; she said, and then her face softened and her eyes glittered with some thought that I knew I wasn&#x2019;t going to like. &#x201c;Defensive of him already, Anita. My, my, he must be better in bed than I remember at that age.&#x201d; </p><p>I leaned in and hissed in her ear. &#x201c;We were all mind-raped by one of the scariest vampires to ever exist, Monica. She used me to feed on his power as a weretiger. She used me, and him, and all the other tigers in a bid to survive even if it meant destroying all of us. You tell me, what part of that was a good thing?&#x201d; I had grabbed her arm somewhere in all that.</p> <p>She spoke low. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re hurting me.&#x201d; </p><p>I let go of her, and stepped back. She looked up at me, and I think for a moment let herself see me, really see me. She was angry, and for just a moment I knew that she didn&#x2019;t like me any more than I liked her, not really. Then I watched a different look cross her face, one that most men would have thought was a good look, but a woman knows when another woman is about to drive the blade home. </p><p>&#x201c;Funny how it&#x2019;s never your fault when you have to have sex with all these men, Anita,&#x201d; and with that she walked away. She walked away with the proverbial knife stuck deep and hard right through my heart. Nothing cuts deeper than when another person says exactly what you&#x2019;re afraid to say out loud. Hell, Matthew had said it, too, in his way. All the big boys kiss you, &#x2019;Nita.</p> <p>I fled the laughing costumed children and Monica&#x2019;s knowing eyes. I waved at Matthew as he called my name, all lined up with the little girls in his class. I wanted to be in my seat so I could see him; he&#x2019;d go on second. Yeah, that was it, I hurried to my seat to make sure I&#x2019;d see his performance, but I knew that wasn&#x2019;t the truth. I ran toward my seat and the men waiting for me, because part of me believed that Monica was right and all my words were just a case of the lady protesting too much. </p></p><h2>Frommer&#39;s England and Scotland (Color Complete Guide)</h2><p>The British Isles are the single most popular trans-Atlantic destination for Americans, and an immense body of book-buyers will be the potential audience for this important new travel guide.

How, Tolstoy asks, does an unreflective man confront his one and only moment of truth? <br>This short novel was the artistic culmination of a profound spiritual crisis in Tolstoy's life, a nine-year period following the publication of Anna Karenina during which he wrote not a word of fiction. A thoroughly absorbing and, at times, terrifying glimpse into the abyss of death, it is also a strong testament to the possibility of finding spiritual salvation.Leo Tolstoy was a Russian novelist and moral philosopher noted for his ideas of nonviolent resistance. His diary reveals an incessant pursuit of a morally justified life. He was known for his generosity to the peasants.His best known novels are War and Peace (1869), which Tolstoy regarded as an epic rather than a novel, and Anna Karenina (1877). His work was admired in his time by Dostoyevsky, Checkov, Turgenev, and Flaubert, and later by Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.</p><h2>Be Happy</h2><p>You can be happy&#x2014;solidly, genuinely happy&#x2014;no matter what's going on around you, no matter what happens to you, no matter what storm comes along to batter and bruise you.<p> Keep reading, and I'll show you how . . .</p><p> Face it: it's not always easy to feel happy.

When was it that my life took this insane detour into the gigantic mess that I now saw when I looked in the mirror? Sure, everything had started so simply. A look, a touch, a kiss. Your first love is supposed to be beautiful, right?<br> <br>And maybe it still is. I don&#x2019;t know. All I do know is that I&#x2019;m kneeling on this nasty bathroom floor in a dingy motel room in the middle of nowhere, wiping my boyfriend&#x2019;s blood off the gritty tiles, the skin of my knees raw from my morbidly methodical task. The sting of tears burns my vision and I feel like I&#x2019;m about to follow him off the edge.<br> <br>Wipe, scrub, sweep. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m doing. Wiping up the turmoil of our relationship. Sweeping away the anger, the hurt, the fear. Scrubbing it all away as I try to figure out how to piece myself back together.<br> <br>But then I remember those elusive moments. The tiny slivers of time that help me recognize that it wasn&#x2019;t all bad. Because I love him. And he loves me, in the only way he can. Perhaps my only failing was not seeing that I wasn&#x2019;t able to hold it together on my own.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;m not one to give up&#x2014;or forget. No matter how much they wanted me to. Because he had, for a moment in time, been my world. My focus, my entire being. And it&#x2019;s hard to think I&#x2019;m now without that. And maybe what we had, for those few blissful months, had truly been beautiful. Crazy beautiful. Or maybe just crazy.<br> <br>Who knows? I was scared, tired, and alone, and missing that vital part of myself that had once felt whole and complete and now felt sad and empty. Wipe, scrub, sweep.<br> <br>The holes would close up. The torn seams would come together. But I would never be as I was before. Before him. My crazy beautiful love.<br><br>Find You In The Dark <br> <br>chapter <br>one<br> <br>&#x201c;you have got to be kidding me.&#x201d; I groaned, kicking the tire of my piece-of-crap Toyota Corolla that had refused to start. Standing in my driveway, I unleashed every curse word imaginable as the minutes slowly ticked toward my inevitable tardiness. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t start again, Maggie-Girl?&#x201d; My father had poked his head out of the screen door. He had most likely been made aware of my predicament by my sailor-worthy tirade.<br> <br>Sighing, I slammed my car door shut and picked up my messenger bag. &#x201c;Nooo . . .&#x201d; I dragged out the word in tired defeat. My dad held the door open for me as I made my way back into the house. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you just have it in the shop two weeks ago?&#x201d; he asked as I slammed my bag down on the kitchen table and threw myself into a chair.<br> <br>I blew my bangs out of my eyes in frustration and didn&#x2019;t bother answering. Everything was going so spectacularly wrong today. I shouldn&#x2019;t have bothered to get out of bed. Maybe I should fake a cough or something and try to convince him to let me stay home.<br> <br>My father took a bite of toast, crumbs falling into his neatly trimmed beard. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll drive you to school. Can&#x2019;t have you missing that big chemistry test.&#x201d; He smirked at me, as if reading my ulterior plot to skip school.<br> <br>I groaned for the millionth time that morning. I&#x2019;d completely forgotten about the test, but of course my dad, with his iron-trap brain, remembered. Well, that thoroughly screwed up any chance of a good day. Merry freaking Monday.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maggie May, what are you still doing here? The tardy bell rings in T-minus-ten minutes.&#x201d; My mother breezed into the kitchen, pouring herself a cup of coffee and conferring with her watch to make sure she wasn&#x2019;t mistaken about the time. Looking at my superserious, all-business, pretty fantastic-looking mother, I wondered, and not for the first time, how I could have come from her DNA. She was my opposite in every possible way: where her hair was blond and shampoo-commercial perfect, mine was a dull, mousy brown that refused to be managed into anything resembling a fashionable style. My mom had a perfect figure. She didn&#x2019;t look anywhere near her age, whereas I had the misfortune of being dubbed a &#x201c;late bloomer.&#x201d; My underwhelming cup size and nonexistent hips were hardly anything to write home about.<br> <br>But I did have her eyes. And I will say, allowing myself zero modesty, that they were pretty awesome. I loved that I shared the same dark-brown eyes and thick lashes. They were my best trait (well, aside from my astounding wit and amazing personality, of course), and I received my fair share of compliments because of them. So, no, you couldn&#x2019;t compare me to the back end of a dog or anything, but, like most teenagers, I was anything but pleased with myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Her car wouldn&#x2019;t start. I&#x2019;m just getting ready to take her to school.&#x201d; My dad filled her in before I could answer. My mom gave me a sympathetic smile before giving her husband a rather obnoxiously sweet kiss good morning. They were really nauseating at times, the way they were still so in love with each other. However, deep down, I just wanted the same thing and I spent a lot of time freaking out that I would never find it. But that was a panic attack for another time.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can help you with it this time, you know. You worked really hard over the summer to buy it and it&#x2019;s been nothing but trouble since you parked it in the driveway.&#x201d; My mom, despite her Barbie-perfect appearance and a no-nonsense accountant&#x2019;s personality, was pretty amazing. I took the bagel she handed to me and licked the cream cheese from the top.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks. But I still have money saved up. Let&#x2019;s just hope I don&#x2019;t need a whole new flipping engine or something,&#x201d; I muttered. My mom ruffled my hair as if I were still five and picked up her briefcase. &#x201c;Well, Marty, if you&#x2019;ve got this under control, I&#x2019;ve got to get to the office. I&#x2019;ll probably be late tonight.&#x201d; My mom ran her own accounting firm in the city&#x2014;and worked a lot.<br> <br>She leaned down and gave me a quick kiss on the forehead and my dad another loud smack and left. I shoved the rest of my bagel into my mouth and wiped my lips with the back of my hand. A napkin appeared under my nose. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you were raised in a barn, Maggie,&#x201d; my dad joked. I lightly touched the napkin to my now-clean mouth, just to make him happy.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can head on out to the car. I&#x2019;ll meet you there. Call Burt&#x2019;s garage today; they&#x2019;ll come and tow the car. Mom and I will pay for the towing, you pay for the repairs. Deal?&#x201d; My dad put his tea mug in the sink and filled it with water. I felt guilty having my parents pay for my car in any way, shape, or form.<br> <br>I had been the one who insisted on buying the shitmobile outside. My dad wanted me to shop around more, to get a CARFAX report; all that rational stuff that I, of course, wouldn&#x2019;t listen to because I was seventeen years old and I knew way more than my parents. Well, I learned that lesson the hard way.<br> <br>But I knew I most likely wouldn&#x2019;t have enough money to pay for the tow and the repairs. My savings from my job at the ice-cream stand over the summer were almost depleted and I would be firmly in mooch territory soon if I didn&#x2019;t find another way to earn money.<br> <br>I mumbled something unintelligible, not bothering to formulate words. Dad only chuckled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll interpret that as a thank-you,&#x201d; he said, shooing me out of the kitchen. I walked out to the family minivan, not focusing too much on the public mortification of my librarian father taking me to school. If I hadn&#x2019;t been feeling so negative, I&#x2019;d have appreciated how considerate he was.<br> <br>I really was lucky in the parental department. My mom and dad always seemed to take my teenage moods in stride. Not much ruffled their feathers. Not that I&#x2019;d done much ruffling in my seventeen years.<br> <br>So here comes the obligatory life rundown: I was your typical teenage girl, living in small-town America (Davidson, Virginia, if you really wanted to know), on the corner of Clich� and Stereotype. My life had been conventional and uneventful. I grew up the only child of the local beauty queen and the bookish guy she fell in love with. We had an apple-pie life of family dinners and games of Monopoly on Thursdays (Wednesdays if it was Mom&#x2019;s week for Bunco).<br> <br>My best friends, Rachel Bradfield and Daniel Lowe, had been my partners in nonexistent crime since the womb. Our mothers had grown up together and it was predetermined that we would be as close as they had been.<br> <br>I was suitably smart, sporting a solid B-plus average, and had aspirations toward college, just like my friends. I did my homework, followed the rules, and basically bored myself to death. I also was in a very deep, crater-sized rut. How sad to be a senior in high school and already done with it all. And the year had only just begun! It was the first week of September.<br> <br>My car&#x2019;s refusal to cooperate this morning only added to my overall malaise. I waited less than patiently in the passenger seat, tapping my fingers on the dashboard in an imperfect rhythm. &#x201c;All right, Maggie-Girl, buckle up.&#x201d; My dad&#x2019;s persistent use of my childhood pet name (only mildly less obnoxious than the fact that I was named after some &#x2019;70s rock song by a guy with really bad hair and a penchant for supermodels) was sort of grating this morning. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if Dad had yet realized that I wasn&#x2019;t ten anymore. My parents had a really hard time accepting that I was&#x2014;gasp&#x2014;almost an adult. Although, to be fair, most days (this morning included) I didn&#x2019;t necessarily act the part.<br> <br>I pulled out my phone and sent a quick text to Rachel and Daniel, letting them know I was running late. Judging by the time, I was at least missing the painful drone of our assistant principal, Mr. Kane, as he read the morning announcements. He always sounded as if he needed to blow his nose.<br> <br>So maybe the day was still salvageable. I tried to minimize conversation as Dad drifted lazily through our tiny town toward the high school. He sang along, rather badly, to the Righteous Brothers, his voice an alarming falsetto. His shoulders swayed with the beat.<br> <br>Dad was being so over the top that I couldn&#x2019;t help but crack the barest hint of a smile. He caught me, of course, my emo facade at an effective end. He let out a whoop. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s my girl&#x2019;s smile! I knew it was hiding somewhere.&#x201d; He reached over and poked me in the side, causing me to squirm and laugh grudgingly.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are such a dork, Dad,&#x201d; I told him, not unkindly. He only grinned and turned up the radio. The auditory torture didn&#x2019;t last much longer before we pulled up in front of Jackson High School. I barely gave my dad time to slow down before I propelled myself from the still-moving vehicle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget to call the garage at lunch,&#x201d; Dad reminded me again. I gave him an ironic salute and turned to walk toward the school. I was glad to see I wasn&#x2019;t the only straggler this morning. A few other kids were hurrying from the parking lot.<br> <br>I fumbled to get my phone out of my jacket pocket, wanting to send a last text to my friends to let them know I was there. I was having a lot of trouble getting it out; thus I was less than attentive as I slammed into the back of someone who had stopped in the middle of the sidewalk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; I yelled as I collided with the very solid body. I dropped my phone, the back popping off and the battery skittering across the concrete. The guy dropped the papers he was holding and they scattered at his feet.<br> <br>We simultaneously let loose a string of expletives that would have earned me a mouth full of soap had my mother heard. &#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; the guy growled, stooping to pick up the items he had dropped in our human fender bender. Okay, I was already in a craptastic mood and his snotty tone was just the icing on an already pissy cake. So, maybe I was being clumsy and all, but I didn&#x2019;t need some random guy giving me grief. &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry; did I miss the Stop sign?&#x201d; I fired back, not bothering to look at the jackass as I tried to fit the broken metal onto the back of my phone.<br> <br>I heard what sounded like a gritting of teeth. &#x201c;Guess it&#x2019;s too much to expect an apology.&#x201d; His sarcasm was thick, his words ground out through an obvious grimace.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; I quipped, finally looking up into the most amazing pair of brown eyes that I had ever seen.<br> <br>Hot damn. Cue the violins and happy cartoon bunnies; I was in the middle of a Disney moment. Because this guy was gorgeous. And we were standing so close to each other. If he hadn&#x2019;t been holding on to a barely contained rage directed at yours truly, it could have almost been construed as romantic.<br> <br>Just add delusions to my growing list of issues.<br> <br>Mr. Cutie stood there in all his infuriated glory&#x2014;and he was seriously angry. His perfectly symmetrical face (covered with a fine dusting of adorable freckles, I might add) was flushed a rather alarming shade of red. Those awesome brown eyes flashed murder. He was quite a bit taller than I, with dark hair that curled around his forehead and ears as if he hadn&#x2019;t bothered with a haircut in a while. He had a cleft in his chin and a tiny scar under his right eye. And, despite his obvious good looks, he appeared decidedly unhinged. Wow, they were only papers.<br> <br>Cute Boy took a deep breath and closed his eyes. I jammed my hands into my pockets and made the decision to get the hell out of there. I started to move around him, making sure to give him a wide berth. His voice, much calmer now, stopped me. &#x201c;Well, you could at least tell me where the main office is. You know, after practically running me over and all.&#x201d;<br> <br>If his tone had been playful, I would have been able to pretend he was flirting with me. But nope, he was terse and irritated and in a very bad mood. And I had had enough of it for one morning. So, his cuteness aside, this guy could go take a flying leap somewhere.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a big boy; I&#x2019;m sure you can handle this one on your own.&#x201d; I turned and quickly walked away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks for nothing!&#x201d; he yelled after me. Yep, Hot Boy came with a bad attitude. Not really my idea of a good time, thank you very much. I couldn&#x2019;t get away fast enough.<br><br>Find You In The Dark <br> <br>chapter <br>two<br> <br>&#x201c;that&#x2019;s it! I&#x2019;m swearing off every member of the female population. Do they still have monasteries? &#x2019;Cause a lifetime of praying and bad haircuts sure as hell beats chicks and their freaking drama.&#x201d; Daniel&#x2019;s lunch tray came down with a loud clang on the table.<br> <br>Rachel and I rolled our eyes in unison and turned to the third member of our trio with what we hoped were supportive expressions. &#x201c;What did Kylie do this time?&#x201d; Rachel asked, popping a Cheeto into her mouth. Daniel ran his hand over his buzzed blond head. He was clearly very agitated. But, honestly, when wasn&#x2019;t he agitated? Daniel was as big a drama queen (or king, or whatever) as any girl.<br> <br>He let out a long, tortured sigh and propped his chin on his hand.

Da Qin&#x2015;<em>Big Piano</em>&#x2015;and her younger sister, Xiao Qin&#x2015;<em>Little Piano</em>&#x2015;live in the city of Wuhan with their parents. For decades, China's government had kept the country separated from the rest of the world. When their country's leader, Chairman Mao, dies, new opportunities begin to emerge. Da Qin and Xiao Qin soon learn that their childhood will be much different than the upbringing their parents experienced.</p></p><p><p> </p> <p>Na Liu is a doctor of hematology and oncology. She moved from Wuhan, China, to Austin, Texas, in 1998 to work as a research scientist for MD Anderson Cancer Center. She met her husband, Andr�s Vera Mart�nez, in Austin. <br> <br> Na Liu and Andr�s Vera Mart�nez live in Brooklyn, New York, with their daughter, Mei Lan. They take annual trips to visit their families in Wuhan and Austin. </p><p>"Graphic memoirs are a cornerstone of the graphic-novel format, but rarely are they written with children as the primary audience. In eight short stories, Liu has done just that, giving younger readers a glimpse into her life growing up in China just after the death of Chairman Mao. By linking her stories to a teaching by Confucius that says one learns in three ways&#x2015;by studying history, by imitating others, and through one's own experience&#x2015;Liu shows how her parents survived the famine during China's Great Leap Forward, how the death of soldier Lei Feng influenced the behavior of Liu and her sister, and how a trip to the countryside to visit her relations helped Liu realize just how privileged her life in the city was. <strong>The stories are vivid even without Martin�z's bold artwork that evokes both traditional Chinese scrolls and midcentury propaganda posters. The result is a memoir that reads like a fable, a good story with a moral that resonates.</strong>" --<em>Booklist Online</em></p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"This title travels through the childhood of Na Liu in Wuhan, China in eight delightful stories. The book is illustrated by her husband with colorful pen and ink drawings. The stories take Na and her sister from the death of Chairman Mao to a visit to her grandmother and relatives who live in the countryside. One of the stories explains the various symbols used during Chinese New Year. The China of her childhood is a different country from her parents'. <strong>This is a beautiful introduction to a China that few of us will ever understand.</strong> The book also contains a glossary of Mandarin Chinese words used as well as translations of Chinese characters in the various chapters." &#x2015;starred, <em>Library Media Connection</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Wife-and-husband team Na Liu and Andr�s Vera Mart�nez use a graphic-novel format to bring Liu&#x2019;s childhood in 1970s Wuhan, China, to life for contemporary children. <br><br>Much will seem the same&#x2015;family life with a younger sister, school, a visit with a semi-scary grandmother&#x2015;but the particulars in the eight vignettes included here make all the difference. Liu recalls her uncontrollable (and uncomprehending) sobbing at the death of a 'grandpa' she did not really know, Chairman Mao; creativity and finally subterfuge is required when her teacher commands each student to bring in four rat tails as evidence of participation in the government campaign to rid the country of vermin. Illustrator Mart�nez gleefully pictures the sisters&#x2019; elaborate fantasies for rat-trapping (like putting a soybean up the butt of one rat, sending it into a frenzy that will cause it to kill the rest of the pack) as well as their eventual mutual admittance that they can't even touch a rat to sever the required tail ('EEEYuu! GROSS!'). <br><br>Author and illustrator together give us an unvarnished and intimate account of a real childhood: plain-speaking, rough-hewn, and very much down-to-earth. While the time and place the book depicts are very different from our own, there's not a hint of sentimentality or exoticism: the scene where the mother shames the girls into cleaning their plates by telling them the real story about starving children in China is simultaneously horrifying and hilarious. A glossary, a chronology, and an author&#x2019;s note provide context." --starred, <em>The Horn Book Magazine </em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Americans today are used to a particular narrative when it comes to Communist China. In the beginning, Maoist ideals provide the Chinese protagonists with comfort and hope. Eventually, though, ideals give way to suffering.</p>My mother's family escaped from mainland China just as the Communist Party came to power. Growing up, I was steeped in this narrative through my family's stories. I opened Na Liu and Andr�s Vera Mart�nez's 'Little White Duck: A Childhood in China' expecting to encounter it once again.'Little White Duck' is a collection of eight autobiographical short stories from Liu's own childhood, illustrated as comics by Mart�nez. Liu grew up in China during the 1970s and '80s, then came to the United States in 1999 as a research scientist. Mart�nez is her American-born husband.Early in the book, a young Liu, nicknamed Da Qin (Big Piano), finds her parents in their kitchen. They tell her that her grandfather has passed away. Da Qin starts to cry, but can't figure out which grandfather they're mourning. Later, her family walks past a giant mural of Chairman Mao. 'Ooooh!' Da Qin says, pointing to the mural. '<em>That</em> grandpa.'Da Qin's parents take her to a vigil for the deceased leader. 'My parents would explain that sad day to me many years later,' Liu writes.I thought Liu would explain 'that sad day' in accordance with my family's stories: perhaps she would describe the horrors of the Cultural Revolution. Maybe Mart�nez would trace the ribs of a re-education camp victim with his delicate brush.Instead, Da Qin tells her family's stories. After her mother got polio, Mao's army performed multiple surgeries free and helped her to walk again. A government scholarship enabled her father to leave behind the backbreaking life of a farmer. Her parents married and made a prosperous life for their two children, Da Qin and her younger sister, Xiao Qin (Little Piano).At this point, I almost put the book down. Reading about the virtues of Chinese Communism felt like a betrayal of my family. However, Liu's writing and Mart�nez's cartooning compelled me to continue.'Little White Duck' isn't Communist propaganda. It is at once more innocent and more sophisticated. What Liu and Mart�nez do is convey a child's-eye view of a country in transition. Politics, culture and history play into their stories, but the reader's awareness of them is a child's awareness. The mural of Mao and the ancient gods and the colorful posters encouraging patriotic behavior are probably important, but fireworks, schemes to catch rats and pretty jackets with soft little white duck-shaped patches are so much more interesting.Liu and Mart�nez perfectly capture that childhood exuberance, but grown-up sensibilities nonetheless underlie their storytelling. Every so often, Mart�nez's panels give way to propagandistic images, forcing a dialogue between Da Qin's real life and the ideal life espoused by her government.Mart�nez maintains a beautiful hand-drawn quality throughout, even in his lettering. This makes the occasional intrusion of blatantly digital effects all the more jarring. In a scene in which Da Qin's family prepares for a New Year celebration, the Chinese calligraphy adorning the hallway is so clearly cut-and-pasted that it undermines the book's intimacy.'Little White Duck' closes with a wrenching tale of Da Qin's trip to the countryside, where she meets her father's relatives for the first time. Her cousins marvel at the soft little white duck-shaped patch on her pretty jacket. Then they blacken it with their dirty fingers. Instead of toys, they play with bugs. Their poverty leaves Da Qin speechless.By realizing that inequality exists even in the People's Republic, Da Qin the child begins to grow into Liu the adult. Perhaps 'Little White Duck' isn't so different from my family's stories after all. By the end of the book, though, I didn't really care, and that's the brilliance of what Liu and Mart�nez have done. Their characters are more than just pieces to be puzzled into someone else's narrative. They're living, breathing people." --<em>The New York Times Book Review</em><br> (<i>Newspaper</i>)<br><br><p>"A striking glimpse into Chinese girlhood during the 1970s and &#x2019;80s. <br><br>Beginning with a breathtaking dream of riding a golden crane over the city of Wuhan, China, Liu Na, recounts her subsequent waking only to discover that Chairman Mao has passed away. The 3-year-old finds this difficult to process and understand, although she is soon caught up in the somber mood of the event. From there, her life unfolds in short sketches. With this intimate look at her childhood memories, Liu skillfully weaves factual tidbits into the rich tapestry of her life. In the section titled 'The Four Pests,' she explains about the four pests that plague China&#x2015;the rat, the fly, the mosquito and the cockroach (with an additional explanation of how the sparrow once made this list, and why it is no longer on it)&#x2015;and her stomach-turning school assignment to catch rats and deliver the severed tails to her teacher. In 'Happy New Year! The Story of Nian the Monster,' she explains the origins of Chinese New Year, her favorite holiday, and her own vivid, visceral reflections of it: the sights, sounds and smells. Extraordinary and visually haunting, there will be easy comparisons to Allen Say's Drawing from Memory (2011); think of this as the female counterpart to that work. <br><br>Beautifully drawn and quietly evocative." --starred, <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br>"This extraordinary memoir offers readers a close-up picture of life in 1970s China.<br>Called 'Da Qin' ('Big Piano'), Na Liu was born near Wuhan, China, in 1973. The book opens as four-year-old Da Qin wakes up next to her younger sister. Thinking she'll be late for school, she grabs a cup, and heads outside to a spigot to brush her teeth. But there is no school today. It is September 6, 1976, and Chairman Mao has died. Unlike many books written by Chinese-born Americans about life under Mao, Na Liu's demonstrates the benefits of the regime to her family, especially to her mother who, paralyzed by polio as a girl, was able to walk again. Andr�s Vera Mart�nez (<em>Babe Ruth</em>), Na Liu's husband, co-author and the artist of the book, uses the graphic novel format to perfection, zeroing in on young Da Qin's face when she sees her parents' sorrow, and conveying the chairman's importance through wide-angle views of Mao's likeness on street murals and banners.<br>In the last and most moving chapter, 'Little White Duck,' Da Qin insists on wearing her coat with a velvet white duck to her Baba's rural village. By the close of the book, Da Qin has learned firsthand of the disparities that her mother and father told her about, and gained compassion because of it. Liu and Mart�nez find the universal moments in the details of an exotic land, inviting readers to see themselves in Da Qin's experiences of friendship, family and country.<br>An extraordinary graphic novel-memoir by a husband-and-wife team offering a rare view of 1970s China." --<em>Shelf Awareness</em><br> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p><strong>"</strong><strong>Based on her childhood experiences, Na Liu and her husband have created a rich, multilayered memoir, incorporating history, geography, language, culture, and mythology into eight short stories; then weaving them together to create an exquisite tapestry of life in China during the 1970s.</strong> The work follows a logical progression, capturing youthful experiences against a broad Chinese landscape. Background information establishes each story and seamlessly segues into personal reminiscence, with excellent interweaving of each section. For example, the introductory dream sequence features Na Liu and her sister flying on a crane's back over panoramic China. The first narrative panel depicts the girls' awakening, with a painting of a white crane visible behind their bed. Mythological origins of New Year transition into an account of the family's celebration, with red banners and a dragon puppet echoing the colors and patterns from the previous holiday description. Scenes of daily life are juxtapostioned against the political climate, retelling simple stories through comic panels that can be enjoyed by young readers, but also delivering interesting perspectives and biting commentary on social issues. The grim realities of government propaganda, social class, and family dynamics make the memoir even more poignant. Humor, as well as the plays on words, enlivens many of the sections. The children's expressive faces provide a personal reaction to these contrasting points of view. <strong>This picturesque treasure introduces Chinese culture through a personal perspective that is both delightful and thought-provoking</strong>." --starred, <em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"A doctor of oncology and hematology, author Liu was born in China in 1973, and her life there for more than 20 years provides plenty of odd autobiographical tidbits for this graphic novel inspired by her experiences. Aimed toward kids, Liu's story captures life in China in the experience of one child, showing how even the broadest governmental policies and cultural standards affect an individual's smallest moments. These darker corners give Liu's reminiscence its power: strict Chinese one-child laws, the graphic misfortune of animals in China, the poverty and surliness of Liu's rural relatives. Yet while the landscape is different, the children's escapades are the same as those of kids today. This is the result of a husband-and-wife collaboration, and the emotional bond of the partnership is clear on every page.<strong> Liu is a calm storyteller whose words are enlivened by Martinez's enthusiastic and energetic art, and their respective tones complement each other fluidly.

It wasn't until he was lucky enough to meet a friendly bunch of elves that Santa found his true calling...and the job of his dreams. <br>Stephen Krensky's understated text and S. D.

As a young man, Santa wants no part of desks or offices. His first job is cleaning chimneys, and he is so good at getting up and down them that he never gets dirty. His second position is with the post office, delivering packages?but people dislike his zeal when he continues delivering into the night. Later, he cooks at an all-night diner (he gains a lot of weight), works at the zoo (he loves the reindeer best), and does a stint with the circus, where he meets elves who live "out of town and need someone to deliver toys." And, of course, the rest is history. Children will love the clever way in which the story builds, showing how Santa's diverse background prepared him perfectly for his Christmas Eve duties. Schindler's amusing, detailed ink drawings include full-page and half-page spreads, and are sometimes set in a white box against a background of want-ad newsprint, also featured on the endpapers.

Hundreds of miles away, another farming family, the good-natured Fiddlers, have been swindled out of their family fortune while reeling from the disappearance of their son Eddie, who left to fight the Germans. When a crime spree sets the Jewetts on a collision course for the Fiddlers, an unlikely--and turbulent--relationship begins between the families. In the gothic tradition of Flannery O&#39;Connor with a heavy dose of cinematic violence reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino, Donald Ray Pollock pens a bloody tale of dark and horrific conflict between two families in an era not so distant from today.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2016:</strong> There&#x2019;s really nobody like Donald Ray Pollock. With a name that sounds like a serial killer&#x2019;s and style to match, he came to the writing game late, publishing the grimly funny and occasionally shocking collection, <em>Knockemstiff</em>, on the windward side of his 50th birthday. <em>The Devil All the Time</em>, another dark ramble through backwoods Ohio, followed, this time expanding his grimy gothic into a fully realized novel. And with his latest, Pollock is neither slowing down nor pulling back. <em>The Heavenly Table</em> splits the tale between two camps: On one side are Cane, Cobb, and Chimney, three brothers of varying dimness suddenly turned loose--at the death of their pious father--to fulfill their kindred potential for violence and larceny. On the other are Ellsworth and Eula Fiddler, increasingly desperate to maintain their farm after losing their "fortune" to a painfully obvious swindle. Suffice to say, Pollock winds up his doomed characters and sets them in motion in a pulpy, peripatetic trajectories in each other's direction. If you're the kind of reader who assesses a book by how well you like its characters, this book probably isn't for you; the best reason to read <em>The Heavenly Table</em> is to witness a writer constantly pushing the borders of imagination--and often propriety--while daring his readers to reassess their own.<em>--Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em>DONALD RAY POLLOCK is the author of the novel <i>The Devil All the Time </i>and the story collection <i>Knockemstiff</i>, recipient of the 2009 PEN/Robert W. Bingham Fellowship. He worked as a laborer at the Mead Paper Mill in Chillicothe, Ohio, from 1973 to 2005.

January 30, 1969 was one of those moments.<br> <br> There are those who were on the periphery of the event that day and <i>heard</i> what was going on; but as one of the few remaining insiders who accompanied the Beatles up onto the cold windswept roof of the Apple building, Ken Mansfield had a front row seat to the full sensory experience of the moment and witnessed what turned out to be beginning of the end. Ken shares in <i>The Roof: The Beatles Final Concert</i>, the sense that something special was taking place before his eyes that would live on forever in the hearts and souls of millions.<br> <br> As the US manager of Apple, Ken Mansfield was on the scene in the days, weeks, and months leading up to this monumental event. He shares his insights into the factors that brought them up onto that roof and why one of the greatest bands of all time left it all on that stage. Join Ken as he reflects on the relationships he built with the Fab Four and the Apple corps and what each player meant to this symphony of music history.</p><p>Ken Mansfield has experienced a life that most people have only read about.&nbsp;He was in the heart and heat of the music industry when it was young and vibrant&#x2014;back when creativity and passion made the music. A simple young man from the Indian reservation lands in Northern Idaho, Ken found himself propelled into the center of a Rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; Roll whirlwind when as a Capitol Records executive the Beatles asked him to be the US Manager of their Apple Record label as well as acting as their personal liaison between the UK and the US. When the Beatles breakup seemed inevitable, he moved on to become a Vice President at MGM Records and then President of Barnaby Records a CBS label owned by Andy Williams.&nbsp;Wanting to fly even higher and faster, he left the corporate world to set up his own company, Hometown Productions Inc., where he produced famous artists of that era such as Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, Don Ho, David Cassidy, Claudine Longet, Nick Gilder, The Flying Burrito Bros.&nbsp;and more.<br> <br>Ken is the author of six books including the top selling <i>T</i><i>he Beatles, The Bible and Bodega Bay</i> (Broadman and Holman) and <i>The White Book</i> (Thomas Nelson).

Author: Alan Parsons, Alan Parsons Project, Multi-Platinum producer and engineer to the Beatles/Pink Floyd<br><br>"Ken Mansfield worked in our offices in London and we crashed at his pad in Hollywood. We all hit it off immediately and he became an instant member of the Apple team. Even the Beatles took to him straight away.

I lived through those Apple years with Ken and we became friends. It is a pleasure to experience so much of it all again through the accuracy of his storytelling and the clarity of his memory." Author: Peter Asher, Peter &amp; Gordon/A&amp;R chief, Apple Records/producer-manager (James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Carole King)<br><br>"Ken has a unique gift. He can take you in the room and you sit with the folk he knows and make you one of the gang, part of the plan. And considering these folk include the Beatles, that is some doing.
